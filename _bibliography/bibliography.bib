V{$\delta$}2+ T cells were cultured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and ascites-infiltrating lymphocytes (AILs) to compare the differences in response to 2-methyl-3-butenyl-1-pyrophosphate (2M3B1-PP) and zoledronate (Zol) as antigens in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To expand V{$\delta$}2+ T cells from PBMCs and AILs from 29 patients with cancer, these cells were cultured and subjected to analysis. RESULTS: The proliferation rate of V{$\delta$}2+ T cells was higher in both PBMCs and AILs when cultured with Zol than with 2M3B1-PP. Although V{$\delta$}2+ T cells show a higher rate of expansion in AILs compared to PBMCs, the number of mixed tumour cells in ascites was decreased when cultured with Zol. CONCLUSION: V{$\delta$}2+ T cells in AILs are cytotoxic to tumour cells in ascites and may be considered in adoptive immunotherapy.},

  abstract = {Cancer immunotherapy has shown great advances during recent years, but it has yet to reach its full potential in all cancer types. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) is now an approved treatment option for certain hematological cancers and has also shown success for some solid cancers. Still, benefit and eligibility do not extend to all patients. ACT with V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells is a promising approach to overcome this hurdle. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of different cytokine conditions on the expansion of V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells in vitro. We could show that V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cell expansion is feasible with two different cytokine conditions: (a) 1,000 U/ml interleukin (IL)-2 and (b) 100 U/ml IL-2 + 100 U/ml IL-15. We did not observe differences in expansion rate or V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cell purity between the conditions; however, IL-2/IL-15-expanded V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells displayed enhanced cytotoxicity against tumor cells, also in hypoxia. While this increase in killing capacity was not reflected in natural killer (NK) cell marker or activation marker expression, we demonstrated that IL-2/IL-15-expanded V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells were characterized by an increased expression of perforin, granzyme B, and granulysin compared to IL-2-expanded cells. These cytotoxic molecules were not only increased in a resting state, but also released to a greater extent upon target recognition. In contrast, CD107a and cytokine expression did not differ between expansion conditions. However, IL-2/IL-15-expanded V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells showed higher levels of transcription factor T-bet expression, which could indicate that T-bet and cytotoxic molecule levels confer the increased cytotoxicity. These results advocate the inclusion of IL-15 into ex vivo V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cell expansion protocols in future clinical studies.},

  abstract = {Adoptive cell transfer using chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) has emerged as one of the most promising new therapeutic modalities for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. Thus far, results in patients with advanced solid tumors have proven disappointing. Constitutive tonic signaling in the absence of ligand is an increasingly recognized complication when deploying these synthetic fusion receptors and can be a cause of poor antitumor efficacy, impaired survival, and reduced persistence in vivo In parallel, ligand-dependent tonic signaling can mediate toxicity and promote T-cell anergy, exhaustion, and activation-induced cell death. Here, we review the mechanisms underpinning CAR tonic signaling and highlight the wide variety of effects that can emerge after making subtle structural changes or altering the methodology of CAR transduction. We highlight strategies to prevent unconstrained tonic signaling and address its deleterious consequences. We also frame this phenomenon in the context of endogenous TCR tonic signaling, which has been shown to regulate peripheral tolerance, facilitate the targeting of foreign antigens, and suggest opportunities to coopt ligand-dependent CAR tonic signaling to facilitate in vivo persistence and efficacy.

  abstract = {TCR-gamma delta ({$\gamma\delta$}) T-cells are considered important players in the graft-vs.-tumor effect following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) and have emerged as candidates for adoptive transfer immunotherapy in the treatment of both solid and hematological tumors. Systemic {$\beta$}-adrenergic receptor ({$\beta$}-AR) activation has been shown to mobilize TCR-{$\gamma\delta$} T-cells to the blood, potentially serving as an adjuvant for alloHCT and TCR-{$\gamma\delta$} T-cell therapy. We investigated if systemic {$\beta$}-AR activation, using acute dynamic exercise as an experimental model, can increase the mobilization, ex vivo expansion, and anti-tumor activity of TCR-{$\gamma\delta$} T-cells isolated from the blood of healthy humans. We also sought to investigate the {$\beta$}-AR subtypes involved, by administering a preferential {$\beta$}1-AR antagonist (bisoprolol) and a non-preferential {$\beta$}1 + {$\beta$}2-AR antagonist (nadolol) prior to exercise as part of a randomized placebo controlled cross-over experiment. We found that exercise mobilized TCR-{$\gamma\delta$} cells to blood and augmented their ex vivo expansion by \textasciitilde 182\% compared to resting blood when stimulated with IL-2 and ZOL for 14-days. Exercise also increased the proportion of CD56+, NKG2D+/CD62L-, CD158a/b/e+ and NKG2A- cells among the expanded TCR-{$\gamma\delta$} cells, and increased their cytotoxic activity against several tumor target cells (K562, U266, 221.AEH) in vitro by 40-60\%. Blocking NKG2D on TCR-{$\gamma\delta$} cells in vitro eliminated the augmented cytotoxic effects of exercise against U266 target cells. Furthermore, administering a {$\beta$}1 + {$\beta$}2-AR (nadolol), but not a {$\beta$}1-AR (bisoprolol) antagonist prior to exercise abrogated the exercise-induced enhancement in TCR-{$\gamma\delta$} T-cell mobilization and ex vivo expansion. Furthermore, nadolol completely abrogated while bisoprolol partially inhibited the exercise-induced increase in the cytotoxic activity of the expanded TCR-{$\gamma\delta$} T-cells. We conclude that acute systemic {$\beta$}-AR activation in healthy donors markedly augments the mobilization, ex vivo expansion, and anti-tumor activity of TCR-{$\gamma\delta$} T-cells and that some of these effects are due to {$\beta$}2-AR signaling and phenotypic shifts that promote a dominant activating signal via NKG2D. These findings highlight {$\beta$}-ARs as potential targets to favorably alter the composition of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell grafts and improve the potency of TCR-{$\gamma\delta$} T-cell immune cell therapeutics.},

Thus, we tested the hypothesis that infusion of ZOL in patients receiving this type of graft may enhance {$\gamma\delta$} T-cell cytotoxic activity against leukemia cells. ZOL was infused every 28 d in 43 patients; most were treated at least twice. {$\gamma\delta$} T cells before and after ZOL treatments were studied in 33 of these 43 patients, till at least 7 mo after HSCT by high-resolution mass spectrometry, flow-cytometry, and degranulation assay. An induction of V{$\delta$}2-cell differentiation, paralleled by increased cytotoxicity of both V{$\delta$}1 and V{$\delta$}2 cells against primary leukemia blasts was associated with ZOL treatment. Cytotoxic activity was further increased in V{$\delta$}2 cells, but not in V{$\delta$}1 lymphocytes in those patients given more than one treatment. Proteomic analysis of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells purified from patients showed upregulation of proteins involved in activation processes and immune response, paralleled by downregulation of proteins involved in proliferation. Moreover, a proteomic signature was identified for each ZOL treatment. Patients given three or more ZOL infusions had a better probability of survival in comparison to those given one or two treatments (86\% vs. 54\%, respectively, p = 0.008). Our data indicate that ZOL infusion in pediatric recipients of {$\alpha\beta$} T- and B-cell-depleted HLA-haploidentical HSCT promotes {$\gamma\delta$} T-cell differentiation and cytotoxicity and may influence the outcome of patients.},

A 3D bone marrow niche model was developed, in which supportive multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells and their osteogenic derivatives were co-cultured with endothelial progenitor cells. These co-cultured cells formed networks within the 3D culture, facilitating the survival and proliferation of primary CD138+ myeloma cells for up to 28~days. During this culture, no genetic drift was observed within the genomic profile of the primary myeloma cells, indicating a stable outgrowth of the cultured CD138+ population. The 3D bone marrow niche model enabled testing of a novel class of engineered immune cells, so called TEGs ({$\alpha\beta$}T cells engineered to express a defined {$\gamma\delta$}TCR) on primary myeloma cells. TEGs were engineered and tested from both healthy donors and myeloma patients. The added TEGs were capable of migrating through the 3D culture, exerting a killing response towards the primary myeloma cells in 6 out of 8 donor samples after both 24 and 48~hours. Such a killing response was not observed when adding mock transduced T cells. No differences were observed comparing allogeneic and autologous therapy. The supporting stromal microenvironment was unaffected in all conditions after 48~hours. When adding TEG therapy, the 3D model surpassed 2D models in many aspects by enabling analyses of specific homing, and both on- and off-target effects, preparing the ground for the clinical testing of TEGs. The model allows studying novel immunotherapies, therapy resistance mechanisms and possible side-effects for this incurable disease.},

It is known that cryopreservation can dramatically reduce viability of primary cells and other cell types after thawing, although the exact effects of cryopreservation on {$\gamma\delta$} T cell health and functionality have not yet been characterized. Our aim was to characterize the effects of a freeze/thaw cycle on {$\gamma\delta$} T cells and to develop an optimized protocol for cryopreservation. {$\gamma\delta$} T cells were expanded under serum-free conditions, using a good manufacturing practice (GMP) compliant protocol developed by our lab. We observed that cryopreservation reduced cell survival and increased the percentage of apoptotic cells, two measures that could not be improved through the use of 5 GMP compliant freezing media. The choice of thawing medium, specifically human albumin (HSA), improved {$\gamma\delta$} T cell viability and in addition, chromatin condensation prior to freezing increased cell viability after thawing, which could not be further improved with the use of a general caspase inhibitor. Finally, we found that cryopreserved cells had depolarized mitochondrial membranes and reduced cytotoxicity when tested against a range of leukemia cell lines. These studies provide a detailed analysis of the effects of cryopreservation on {$\gamma\delta$} T cells and provide methods for improving viability in the post-thaw period.},

Given the natural tropism of {$\gamma\delta$}T cells for the tumor microenvironment, we hypothesized that their transduction with CARs might enhance cytotoxicity while retaining their ability to migrate to tumor and act as antigen-presenting cells to prolong the intratumoral immune response. Using a GD2-targeting CAR as a model system, we showed that {$\gamma\delta$}T cells of both V{$\delta$}1 and V{$\delta$}2 subsets could be expanded and transduced to sufficient numbers for clinical studies. The CAR added to the cells' innate cytotoxicity by enhancing GD2-specific killing of GD2-expressing cancer cell lines. Migration toward tumor cells \emph{in vitro} was not impaired by the presence of the CAR. Expanded CAR-transduced V{$\delta$}2 cells retained the ability to take up tumor antigens and cross presented the processed peptide to responder alpha beta T ({$\alpha\beta$}T) lymphocytes. {$\gamma\delta$} CAR-T cell products show promise for evaluation in clinical studies of solid tumors.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are promising cancer therapeutic agents, with the prospect of becoming the ultimate smart cancer therapeutics. To expand the capability of CAR T cells, here we present a split, universal, and programmable (SUPRA) CAR system that simultaneously encompasses multiple critical ``upgrades'', such as the ability to switch targets without re-engineering the T cells, finely tune T cell activation strength, and sense and logically respond to multiple antigens. These features are useful to combat relapse, mitigate over-activation, and enhance specificity. We test our SUPRA system against two different tumor models to demonstrate its broad utility and humanize its components to minimize potential immunogenicity concerns. Furthermore, we extend the orthogonal SUPRA CAR system to regulate different T cell subsets independently, demonstrating a dually inducible CAR system. Together, these SUPRA CARs illustrate that multiple advanced logic and control features can be implemented into a single, integrated system.,  , A chimeric antigen receptor system that can integrate signals from multiple antigens and fine tune T cell activation in a cell type-specific manner holds promises for enhancing the safety and specificity of CAR T cell therapies for cancer treatment.},

Aside from CAR T cells for treating B cell malignancies, most T cell therapies are risky, toxic, and often ineffective, especially those that target solid cancers. To fulfill the promise of cell-based therapies, we must transform cell engineering into a systematic and predictable science by applying the principles and tools of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology uses a hierarchical approach\textemdash assembling sets of modular molecular parts that can be combined into larger circuits and systems that perform defined target tasks.

  abstract = {{$\gamma\delta$} T cells are unconventional lymphocytes that could play a role in bridging the innate and adaptive immune system. Upon initial exposure to an antigen, some activated T cells become memory T cells that could be reactivated upon secondary immune challenge. Recently, subsets of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells with a restricted antigen repertoire and long-term persistence have been observed after clearance of viral and bacterial infections. These {$\gamma\delta$} T cells possess the hallmark ability of memory T cells to respond more strongly and proliferate to a higher extent upon secondary infection. Murine and primate models of Listeria monocytogenes and cytomegalovirus infection display these memory hallmarks and demonstrate {$\gamma\delta$} T cell memory responses. In addition, human and non-human primate infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as well as non-human primate infection with monkeypox and studies on patients suffering from autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis) reveal memory-like responses corresponding with disease. Murine models of psoriatic disease (imiquimod) and parasite infections (malaria) exhibited shifts to memory phenotypes with repeated immune challenge. These studies provide strong support for the formation of immune memory in {$\gamma\delta$} T cells, and memory {$\gamma\delta$} T cells may have a widespread role in protective immunity and autoimmunity.},

V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2-T cell-based cancer immunotherapeutic approaches developed so far have been generally well tolerated and were able to induce significant clinical responses. However, overall results were inconsistent, possibly due to the fact that these strategies induced systemic activation of V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2-T cells without preferential accumulation and targeted activation in the tumor.

Tumor cell lysis was independent of KRAS and BRAF tumor mutation status and common V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2-T cell receptor sequence variations. In combination with the conserved monomorphic nature of the V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2-TCR and the facile replacement of the tumor-specific nanobody, this immunotherapeutic approach can be applied to a large group of cancer patients.},

Progress, however, has been hampered by low efficacy and high toxicity. Tumor targeting by V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells, a conserved T-cell subset with potent intrinsic antitumor properties, mediated by a bispecific antibody represents a novel approach promising high efficacy with limited toxicity. Here, we describe the generation of a bispecific V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T-cell engager directed against CD40, which, due to its overexpression and biological footprint in malignant B cells, represents an attractive target. The CD40-targeting moiety of the bispecific antibody was selected because it can prevent CD40L-induced prosurvival signaling and reduce CD40-mediated resistance of CLL cells to venetoclax. Selective activation of V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells in the presence of CD40+ tumor cells induced potent V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T-cell degranulation, cytotoxicity against CLL and MM cells in vitro, and in vivo control of MM in a xenograft model. The CD40-bispecific {$\gamma\delta$} T-cell engager demonstrated lysis of leukemic cells by autologous V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells present in patient-derived samples. Taken together, our CD40 bispecific {$\gamma\delta$} T-cell engager increased the sensitivity of leukemic cells to apoptosis and induced a potent V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cell-dependent antileukemic response. It may, therefore, represent a potential candidate for the development of novel treatments for B-cell malignancies.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Although considerable progress has been made with autologous T cell-based therapy in B-cell malignancies, application in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) lags behind due to disappointing response rates as well as substantial toxicity that is of particular concern in the elderly CLL population. V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2-T cells form a conserved T-cell subset with strong intrinsic immunotherapeutic potential, largely because of their capacity to be triggered by phosphoantigens that can be overproduced by CLL and other malignant cells. Specific activation of V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2-T cells by a bispecific antibody may improve the efficacy and toxicity of autologous T-cell-based therapy in CLL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated CD1d expression in a cohort of 78 untreated patients with CLL and generated and functionally characterized a CD1d-specific V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2-T cell engager based on single-domain antibodies (VHH). RESULTS: CD1d was expressed by CLL in the majority of patients, particularly in patients with advanced disease. The CD1d-specific V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2-T cell engager induced robust activation and degranulation of V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2-T cells, enabling V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2-T cells from patients with CLL to lyse autologous leukemic cells at low effector-to-target ratios. Expression of CD1d on CLL cells is upregulated by all-trans retinoic acid, and sensitizes the malignant cells to bispecific VHH-induced lysis. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2-T cell receptor retains responsiveness to phosphoantigens when the bispecific VHH is bound, and aminobisphosphonates can therefore enhance bispecific V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2-T cell engager-mediated tumor-specific killing. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data demonstrate the immunotherapeutic potential of this novel CD1d-specific V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2-T cell engager in CLL.},

  abstract = {Introduction: We report the first analysis of a multicenter prospective single-arm phase I/II study that assesses the safety and feasibility of transplantation of TCRalpha/beta depleted stem cells from matched related or unrelated donors using the CliniMACS plus System (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) in combination with a non-myeloablative conditioning in adult patients (trial nr NL48606.000.14). The conditioning regimen consisted of ATG (Thymoglobulin\textregistered ) 1.5mg/kg i.v. days -12 to -9; fludarabine i.v. 40 mg/m2 days -5 to -2 and busulfan i.v. (Busivex\textregistered ) days -5 to -2 (cumulative AUC of 80-90mg*h/L), followed by 28 days of mycophenolic acid. All 35 subjects were eligible to address the primary endpoint which is the incidence of acute GVHD at day 100.Results: 2 centers enrolled 10 female and 25 male patients (median age 59 years, range 19 - 69 years), including 9 AML, 4 ALL, 2 CML, 5 MM, 1 NHL, 10 MDS, 4 MPN. Diseases were in CR (n=17), VGPR (n=1), PR (n=5) or non-remission (n=12). 4 subjects had one or more previous allogeneic SCTs. Donors included 4 MRD, 24 10/10 matched MUD and 7 9/10 matched MUD. 8 male patients received stem cells of female donors. The median number of CD34+ cells and {$\alpha\beta$} TCR cells/kg was 6.1x 10\^6 (range, 1.9-10) and 14.5x10\^3 (range, 0-136), respectively. One primary graft failure was observed. Primary engraftment of ANCs \&gt; 500 cells/{$\mu$}L was reached at a median of 14 days (range 9 - 48 days) and of platelets \&gt; 20 at a median of 17 days (range 10 - 99) days.The median time of follow-up of this first analysis was 190 days (range 110-400 days). 3/35 patients developed acute GVHD grade III-IV during the first 100 days, 9/35 patients developed acute GVHD grade II-IV and 16/35 patients grade I-IV at day 100. At day 100 the cumulative incidence (CI) of CMV was 31\%, of EBV 36\% and of BK cystitis 20\%. The combined CI of CMV/EBV/BK infections with a CTC-AE grade III-V was 53\% at day 100.Immune reconstitution was rapid with a median of 227 (range 34 - 1626) CD3+ cells/\textmu l on day 100 but varied substantially between patients. The median numbers of CD3/CD4+ and CD3/CD8+ at day 100 post transplant were 60 (range 30 - 120) and 124 (range 5 - 1450) cells/\textmu l. The median numbers of NK were 289 (range 32-1140) at day 30 and 128 (range 24 - 1228) cells/\textmu l at day 100 post transplant. The median numbers of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells were 38 (range 4-143) at day 30 and 50 (range 8-556) cells/\textmu l at day 100 post transplant.26 out of 35 patients were alive, 2 patients died of a relapse, 2 of GVHD and 5 of infectious complications. Kaplan Meier estimates of the OS are 88\% (+/- 6\%) at day 100 and 68\% (+/- 9\%) at 1Y. Kaplan Meier estimates of the EFS are 77\% (+/- 7\%) at day 100 and 52\% (+/- 10\%) at 1Y. 2 patients developed a relapse before day 100 and 5 patients before 1Y. It is noted that the outcome of 5 patients with MM was very poor in this cohort (3 patients developed a relapse and 2 patients died of complications).Conclusion: Allo-SCT of {$\alpha\beta$} T cell depleted PBMCs form matched related or unrelated donors, in combination with early ATG and a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen, resulted in favorable rates of primary engraftment (34/35), a CI of aGVHD II-IV of 26\% with only minimal immuno-suppression and an encouraging early disease control (Fig 1). OS survival was mainly impacted by NRM (Fig 1), by which the majority of complications were of infectious nature. While all patients with MM suffered from NRM or relapse, all other disease categories had a rather favorable outcome. Reducing inter-individual variations in immune reconstitution early after transplantation will be key to further improve outcomes.Minnema:Amgen: Consultancy; Takeda: Consultancy; Celgene: Consultancy, Research Funding; Janssen: Consultancy; Servier: Consultancy.

  abstract = {Human adenovirus infection is life threatening after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Immunotherapy with donor-derived adenovirus-specific T cells is promising; however, 20\% of all donors lack adenovirus-specific T cells. To overcome this, we transfected {$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} T cells with mRNA encoding a T-cell receptor (TCR) specific for the HLA-A*0101-restricted peptide LTDLGQNLLY from the adenovirus hexon protein. Furthermore, since allo-reactive endogenous TCR of donor T lymphocytes would induce graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in a mismatched patient, we transferred the TCR into {$\gamma$}/{$\delta$} T cells, which are not allo-reactive. TCR-transfected {$\gamma$}/{$\delta$} T cells secreted low quantities of cytokines after antigen-specific stimulation, which were increased dramatically after co-transfection of CD8{$\alpha$}-encoding mRNA. In direct comparison with TCR-transfected {$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} T cells, TCR-CD8{$\alpha$}-co-transfected {$\gamma$}/{$\delta$} T cells produced more tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and lysed peptide-loaded target cells as efficiently. Most importantly, TCR-transfected {$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} T cells and TCR-CD8{$\alpha$}-co-transfected {$\gamma$}/{$\delta$} T cells efficiently lysed adenovirus-infected target cells. We show here, for the first time, that not only {$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} T cells but also {$\gamma$}/{$\delta$} T cells can be equipped with an adenovirus specificity by TCR-RNA electroporation. Thus, our strategy offers a new means for the immunotherapy of adenovirus infection after allogeneic HSCT.},

In over two decades since the first report, the EBMT indications manuscripts have incorporated changes in transplant practice coming from scientific and technical developments in the field. In this same period, the establishment of JACIE accreditation has promoted high quality and led to improved outcomes of patient and donor care and laboratory performance in transplantation and cellular therapy. An updated report with operating definitions, revised indications and an additional set of data with overall survival at 1 year and non-relapse mortality at day 100 after transplant in the commonest standard-of-care indications is presented.

We targeted breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSC), a rare cell population responsible for patient mortality. BCSC were mostly susceptible to {$\gamma\delta$}Tc immunotherapy, yet some escaped. The BCSC secretome rendered {$\gamma\delta$}Tc hypo-responsive, and resistant BCSC expressed more PD-L1 and anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 than non-stem-like cells (NSC). BCSC resistance was partially overcome by dMCL1-2, an MCL-1 degrader, or more fully by blocking PD-1 on {$\gamma\delta$}Tc. Increased MICA shedding was prevented by the ADAM inhibitor GW280264X, rendering BCSC as sensitive to {$\gamma\delta$}Tc cytotoxicity as NSC. Our data show promising potential for {$\gamma\delta$}Tc immunotherapy against BCSC while unraveling immune evasion mechanisms exploited by BCSC, which likely also enable their resistance to cytotoxic T and NK cells. Overcoming this resistance, as we have done here, will improve cancer immunotherapy, leading to better cancer patient outcomes.},

A limitation of CAR technology is on-target off-tumor toxicity caused by target antigen expression on normal cells. Using GD2 as a model cancer antigen, we hypothesized that this could be minimized by using T~cells expressing V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 TCR, which recognizes transformed cells in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-unrestricted manner, in combination with a co-stimulatory CAR that would function independently of the TCR. An anti-GD2 CAR containing a solitary endodomain derived from the NKG2D adaptor DAP10 was expressed in V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2+ T~cells. Differential ligation of the CAR and/or TCR using antibody-coated beads showed that pro-inflammatory cytokine response depended on activation of both receptors. Moreover, in killing assays, GD2-expressing neuroblastoma cells that engaged the V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 TCR were efficiently lysed, whereas cells that expressed GD2 equivalently but did not engage the V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 TCR were untouched. Differentiation between X-on tumor and X-off tumor offers potential for safer immunotherapy and broader target selection.},

  abstract = {Despite the benefits of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies against lymphoid malignancies, responses in solid tumors have been more limited and off-target toxicities have been more marked. Among the possible design limitations of CAR-T cells for cancer are unwanted tonic (antigen-independent) signaling and off-target activation. Efforts to overcome these hurdles have been blunted by a lack of mechanistic understanding. Here, we showed that single-cell analysis with time course mass cytometry provided a rapid means of assessing CAR-T cell activation. We compared signal transduction in expanded T cells to that in T cells transduced to express second-generation CARs and found that cell expansion enhanced the response to stimulation. However, expansion also induced tonic signaling and reduced network plasticity, which were associated with expression of the T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and TIM-3. Because this was most evident in pathways downstream of CD3{$\zeta$}, we performed similar analyses on {$\gamma\delta$}T cells that expressed chimeric costimulatory receptors (CCRs) lacking CD3{$\zeta$} but containing DAP10 stimulatory domains. These CCR-{$\gamma\delta$}T cells did not exhibit tonic signaling but were efficiently activated and mounted cytotoxic responses in the presence of CCR-specific stimuli or cognate leukemic cells. Single-cell signaling analysis enabled detailed characterization of CAR-T and CCR-T cell activation to better understand their functional activities. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CCR-{$\gamma\delta$}T cells may offer the potential to avoid on-target, off-tumor toxicity and allo-reactivity in the context of myeloid malignancies.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The majority of circulating human {$\gamma\delta$}T lymphocytes are of the V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 lineage, and have T-cell receptor (TCR) specificity for nonpeptide phosphoantigens. Previous attempts to stimulate and expand these cells have therefore focused on stimulation using ligands of the V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 receptor, whereas relatively little is known about variant blood {$\gamma\delta$}T subsets and their potential role in cancer immunotherapy. Experimental Design: To expand the full repertoire of {$\gamma\delta$}T without bias toward specific TCRs, we made use of artificial antigen-presenting cells loaded with an anti {$\gamma\delta$}TCR antibody that promoted unbiased expansion of the {$\gamma\delta$}T repertoire. Expanded cells from adult blood donors were sorted into 3 populations expressing respectively V{$\delta$}2 TCR chains (V{$\delta$}2+), V{$\delta$}1 chains (V{$\delta$}1+), and TCR of other {$\delta$} chain subtypes (V{$\delta$}1negV{$\delta$}2neg). Results: Both freshly isolated and expanded cells showed heterogeneity of differentiation markers, with a less differentiated phenotype in the V{$\delta$}1 and V{$\delta$}1negV{$\delta$}2neg populations. Expanded cells were largely of an effector memory phenotype, although there were higher numbers of less differentiated cells in the V{$\delta$}1+ and V{$\delta$}1negV{$\delta$}2neg populations. Using neuroblastoma tumor cells and the anti-GD2 therapeutic mAb ch14.18 as a model system, all three populations showed clinically relevant cytotoxicity. Although killing by expanded V{$\delta$}2 cells was predominantly antibody dependent and proportionate to upregulated CD16, V{$\delta$}1 cells killed by antibody-independent mechanisms. Conclusions: In conclusion, we have demonstrated that polyclonal-expanded populations of {$\gamma\delta$}T cells are capable of both antibody-dependent and -independent effector functions in neuroblastoma.

However, redirecting CAR T~cells to malignant T~cells is more challenging due to product-specific cis- and trans-activation causing fratricide. Other challenges include the potential for product contamination and T~cell aplasia. We expressed non-signaling CARs (NSCARs) in {$\gamma\delta$} T~cells since donor-derived {$\gamma\delta$} T~cells can be used to prevent product contamination, and NSCARs lack signaling/activation domains, but retain antigen-specific tumor cell-targeting capability. As a result, NSCAR targeting requires an alternative cytotoxic mechanism, which can be achieved through utilization of {$\gamma\delta$} T~cells that possess major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-independent cytotoxicity. We designed two distinct NSCARs and demonstrated that they do not enhance tumor-killing by {$\alpha\beta$} T~cells, as predicted. However, both CD5-NSCAR- and CD19-NSCAR-modified {$\gamma\delta$} T~cells enhanced cytotoxicity against T and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL and B-ALL) cell lines, respectively. CD5-NSCAR expression in {$\gamma\delta$} T~cells resulted in a 60\% increase in cytotoxicity of CD5-expressing T-ALL cell lines. CD19-NSCAR-modified {$\gamma\delta$} T~cells exhibited a 350\% increase in cytotoxicity against a CD19-expressing B-ALL cell line compared to the cytotoxicity of naive cells. NSCARs may provide a mechanism to enhance antigen-directed anti-tumor cytotoxicity of {$\gamma\delta$} T~cells through the introduction of a high-affinity interaction while avoiding self-activation.},

There are many challenges in translating this therapy for T cell disease, including fratricide, T cell aplasia, and product contamination. To the best of our knowledge, no tumor-specific antigen has been identified with universal expression on cancerous T cells, hindering CAR T cell therapy for these malignancies. Numerous approaches have been assessed to address each of these challenges, such as (i) disrupting target antigen expression on CAR-modified T cells, (ii) targeting antigens with limited expression on T cells, and (iii) using third party donor cells that are either non-alloreactive or have been genome edited at the T cell receptor {$\alpha$} constant (TRAC) locus. In this review, we discuss CAR approaches that have been explored both in preclinical and clinical studies targeting T cell antigens, as well as examine other potential strategies that can be used to successfully translate this therapy for T cell disease.},

Experimental Design: We evaluated the anti-MM activity of the fully human BCMA\texttimes CD3 bispecific antibody JNJ-7957 in cell lines and bone marrow (BM) samples. The impact of several tumor- and host-related factors on sensitivity to JNJ-7957 therapy was also evaluated. Results: We show that JNJ-7957 has potent activity against 4 MM cell lines, against tumor cells in 48 of 49 BM samples obtained from MM patients, and in 5 of 6 BM samples obtained from primary plasma cell leukemia patients. JNJ-7957 activity was significantly enhanced in patients with prior daratumumab treatment, which was partially due to enhanced killing capacity of daratumumab-exposed effector cells. BCMA expression did not affect activity of JNJ-7957. High T-cell frequencies and high effector:target ratios were associated with improved JNJ-7957\textendash mediated lysis of MM cells. The PD-1/PD-L1 axis had a modest negative impact on JNJ-7957 activity against tumor cells from daratumumab-na\"ive MM patients. Soluble BCMA impaired the ability of JNJ-7957 to kill MM cells, although higher concentrations were able to overcome this negative effect. Conclusions: JNJ-7957 effectively kills MM cells ex vivo, including those from heavily pretreated MM patients, whereby several components of the immunosuppressive BM microenvironment had only modest effects on its killing capacity. Our findings support the ongoing trial with JNJ-7957 as single agent and provide the preclinical rationale for evaluating JNJ-7957 in combination with daratumumab in MM.},

Dendritic cells (DCs) are documented to be the most potent professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) able to induce adaptive immunity and support the innate immune response independently from T cells. Several data show that the cross-talk of {$\gamma\delta$} T lymphocytes with DCs can play a crucial role in the orchestration of immune response by bridging innate to adaptive immunity. In the last decade, DCs, as well as {$\gamma\delta$} T cells, have been of increasing clinical interest, especially as monotherapy for cancer immunotherapy, even though with unpredictable results mainly due to immune suppression and/or tumor-immune escape. For these reasons, new vaccine strategies have to be explored to reach cancer immunotherapy's full potential. The effect of DC-based vaccines on {$\gamma\delta$} T cell is less extensively investigated, and a combinatorial approach using DC-based vaccines with {$\gamma\delta$} T cells might promote a strong synergy for long-term tumor control and protection against escaping tumor clones. Here, we discuss the therapeutic potential of the interaction between DCs and {$\gamma\delta$} T cells to improve cancer vaccination. In particular, we describe the most relevant and updated evidence of such combinatorial approaches, including the use of Zoledronate, Interleukin-15, and protamine RNA, also looking towards future strategies such as CAR therapies.},

Nevertheless, it has been significantly more problematic to effect long term clinical benefit in a solid tumour context. A major contributing factor to the clinical failure of CAR-T-cells in solid tumours has been named, almost interchangeably, as T-cell "dysfunction" or "exhaustion". While unhelpful ambiguity surrounds the term "dysfunction", "exhaustion" is canonically regarded as a pejorative term for T-cells. Recent understanding of T-cell developmental biology now identifies exhausted cells as vital for effective immune responses in the context of ongoing antigenic challenge. The purpose of this review is to explore the critical stages in the CAR-T-cell life-cycle and their various contributions to T-cell exhaustion. Through an appreciation of the predominant mechanisms of CAR-T-cell exhaustion and resultant dysfunction, we describe a range of engineering approaches to improve CAR-T-cell function.},

However, clinical trials have so far reported only limited tumor control by adoptively transferred {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2T cells. As a potential explanation for this lack of efficacy, we found unexpectedly high variability in tumor recognition within the physiologic human {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2T-cell repertoire, which is substantially regulated by the CDR3 domains of individual {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2TCRs. In the present study, we demonstrate that the reported molecular requirements of CDR3 domains to interact with target cells shape the physiologic {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2T-cell repertoire and, most likely, limit the protective and therapeutic antitumor efficacy of {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2T cells. Based on these findings, we propose combinatorial-{$\gamma\delta$}TCR-chain exchange as an efficient method for designing high-affinity {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2TCRs that mediate improved antitumor responses when expressed in {$\alpha\beta$}T cells both in vitro and in vivo in a humanized mouse model.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Despite the ability of gdT cells to mediate tumor killing independently of MHC recognition, all the clinical trials that have been carried out using these cells showed low response rate in patients, in part due to its poor proliferation ability. Recently, a new generation of CAR-T cells called abT cells engineered to express a defined gdTCR (TEG) has been developed. TEGs are abT cells engineered to express a defined gdTCR. These cells are able to mediate effective antitumor reactivity without showing any reactivity towards healthy tissue, and combine the best qualities of both abT and gdT cells. In fact, the high affinity g9d2TCR clone 5 has recently been selected within the TEG format as a clinical candidate (TEG001). Here we present a strategy to improve the antitumor activity of TEG001 by co-expressing an activating chimeric co-receptor together with gdTCR-Cl5.Therefore, we developed three different co-receptors by fusing the extracellular domain of the activating cell surface receptor NKG2D, that is able to bind stress induced ligands typically expressed on tumor cells, to the cytoplasmic signaling domains of the T cell costimulatory proteins ICOS, CD28 and 4-1BB. We determined that introduction of the chimeric co-receptors NKG2D-CD28wt and NKG2D-4-1BBCD28TM improved the activity of TEG001 against tumors that were recognized by gdTCR-Cl5 and expressed NKG2D ligands, but did not affect tumors that either were not recognized by gdTCR-Cl5 or did not express NKG2D ligands. This chimeric co-receptors approach open a wide range of opportunities that lead to a next generation of TEGs.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Increasing immunological knowledge and advances in techniques lay the ground for more efficient and broader application of immunotherapies. gamma delta ({$\gamma\delta$}) T-cells possess multiple favorable anti-tumor characteristics, making them promising candidates to be used in cellular and combination therapies of cancer. They recognize malignant cells, infiltrate tumors, and depict strong cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory activity. Here, we focus on human V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T-cells, the most abundant {$\gamma\delta$} T-cell subpopulation in the blood, which are able to inhibit cancer progression in various models in vitro and in vivo. For therapeutic use they can be cultured and manipulated ex vivo and in the following adoptively transferred to patients, as well as directly stimulated to propagate in vivo. In clinical studies, V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T-cells repeatedly demonstrated a low toxicity profile but hitherto only the modest therapeutic efficacy. This review provides a comprehensive summary of established and newer strategies for the enhancement of V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T-cell anti-tumor functions. We discuss data of studies exploring methods for the sensitization of malignant cells, the improvement of recognition mechanisms and cytotoxic activity of V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T-cells. Main aspects are the tumor cell metabolism, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, antibody constructs, as well as activating and inhibitory receptors like NKG2D and immune checkpoint molecules. Several concepts show promising results in vitro, now awaiting translation to in vivo models and clinical studies. Given the array of research and encouraging findings in this area, this review aims at optimizing future investigations, specifically targeting the unanswered questions.},

  abstract = {Background CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells demonstrate remarkable remission rates in pediatric and adult patients with refractory or relapsed (r/r) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In 2016, we initiated a clinical trial with in-house produced CD19 CAR-T cells with a CD28 co-stimulatory domain. We analyzed, for the first time, differences in production features and phenotype between ALL and NHL patients. Methods Non-cryopreserved CAR-T cells were produced from patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells within 9 to 10 days. 93 patients with r/r ALL and NHL were enrolled under the same study. CAR-T cells of ALL and NHL patients were produced simultaneously, allowing the head-to-head comparison. Results All patients were heavily pretreated. Three patients dropped out from the study due to clinical deterioration (n=2) or production failure (n=1). Cells of ALL patients (n=37) expanded significantly better and contained more CAR-T cells than of NHL patients (n=53). Young age had a positive impact on the proliferation capacity. The infusion products from ALL patients contained significantly more na\"ive CAR-T cells and a significantly higher expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR3. PD-1, LAG-3, TIM-3, and CD28 were equally expressed. 100\% of ALL patients and 94\% of NHL patients received the target dose of 1\texttimes 10e6 CAR-T/kg. The overall response rate was 84\% (30/36) in ALL and 62\% (32/52) in NHL. We further compared CAR-T cell infusion products to tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), another common type of T cell therapy, mainly clinically effective in solid tumors. CAR-T cells contained significantly more na\"ive T cells and central memory T cells and significantly less CCR5 compared to TIL infusion products. Conclusions The in-house production of CAR-T cells is highly efficient and fast. Clinical response rate is high. CAR-T cells can be successfully produced for 99\% of patients in just 9 to 10 days. Cells derived from ALL patients demonstrate a higher proliferation rate and contain higher frequencies of CAR-T cells and na\"ive T cells than of NHL patients. In addition, understanding the differences between CAR-T and TIL infusion products, may provide an angle to develop CAR-T cells for the treatment of solid tumors in the future.

A purification strategy was introduced that combined maximal interference of {$\gamma\delta$}TCR chains with endogenous TCR chains with a GMP-grade anti-{$\alpha\beta$}TCR-bead-based depletion strategy to obtain a pure population of engineered immune cells (Straetemans et al. 2015). TEG001 cells showed a strong and broad recognition of hematological malignancies against both cell lines and primary AML (Marcu-Malina et al. 2011, Gr\"under et al. 2012). To further broaden the clinical implementation of this novel strategy we here investigated the in vivo efficacy profile against solid malignancies. In this study, we evaluated clinical potency of TEG001 against human organoids engineered with most frequent mutations for colorectal cancer, including APC knockout (APCKO), constitutively active KRAS (KRASG12D), P53 knockout (P53KO), and SMAD4 knockout (SMAD4KO), also known as quadruple mutant organoids. These organoids are tumorigenic and can be successfully engrafted as solid tumor mass in immunodeficient mice (Fumagalli et al., 2017; Drost et al., 2015). Irradiated NSG mice received luciferase-positive quadruple mutant organoids subcutaneously and were subsequently infused with TEGs. Tumor growth was measured by bioluminescence imaging. TEG001 showed reduced tumor growth of quadruple mutant organoids compared to untreated and mock controls. Moreover, TEG001-treated mice showed increased overall survival relative to the control mice, followed up to 130 days after treatment. Our current data shows that TEG001 mediates antitumor reactivity against quadruple mutant organoids as solid tumor model in vivo. This xenograft model allows further preclinical testing of next generation TEGs targeted to solid malignancies. Importantly, TEGs are a promising addition to the currently available immune therapeutic strategies as they target cancer as a metabolic disorder.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2T cells, which express V{$\gamma$}9 and V{$\delta$}2 chains of the T cell receptor (TCR), mediate cancer immune surveillance by sensing early metabolic changes in malignant leukemic blast and not their healthy hematopoietic stem counterparts via the {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2TCR targeting joined conformational and spatial changes of CD277 at the cell membrane (CD277J). This concept led to the development of next generation CAR-T cells, so-called TEGs: {$\alpha\beta$}T cells Engineered to express a defined {$\gamma\delta$}TCR. The high affinity {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2TCR clone 5 has recently been selected within the TEG format as a clinical candidate (TEG001). However, exploring safety and efficacy against a target, which reflects an early metabolic change in tumor cells, remains challenging given the lack of appropriate tools. Therefore, we tested whether TEG001 is able to eliminate established leukemia in a primary disease model, without harming other parts of the healthy hematopoiesis in vivo. METHODS: Separate sets of NSG mice were respectively injected with primary human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts and cord blood-derived human progenitor cells from healthy donors. These mice were then treated with TEG001 and mock cells. Tumor burden and human cells engraftment were measured in peripheral blood and followed up over time by quantifying for absolute cell number by flow cytometry. Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric 2-tailed Mann-Whitney t-test. RESULTS: We successfully engrafted primary AML blasts and healthy hematopoietic cells after 6-8\,weeks. Here we report that metabolic cancer targeting through TEG001 eradicated established primary leukemic blasts in vivo, while healthy hematopoietic compartments derived from human cord-blood remained unharmed in spite of TEGs persistence up to 50\,days after infusion. No additional signs of off-target toxicity were observed in any other tissues. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of humanized PD-X models, targeting CD277J by TEG001 is safe and efficient. Therefore, we have initiated clinical testing of TEG001 in a phase I first-in-human clinical trial (NTR6541; date of registration 25 July 2017).},

  abstract = {{$\gamma\delta$}T cells play an important role in cancer immunosurveillance and are able to distinguish malignant cells from their healthy counterparts via their {$\gamma\delta$}TCR. This characteristic makes {$\gamma\delta$}T cells an attractive candidate for therapeutic application in cancer immunotherapy. Previously, we have identified a novel CD8{$\alpha$}-dependent tumor-specific allo-HLA-A*24:02-restricted V{$\gamma$}5V{$\delta$}1TCR with potential therapeutic value when used to engineer {$\alpha\beta$}T cells from HLA-A*24:02 harboring individuals. {$\alpha\beta$}T cells engineered to express this defined V{$\gamma$}5V{$\delta$}1TCR (TEG011) have been suggested to recognize spatial changes in HLA-A*24:02 present selectively on tumor cells but not their healthy counterparts. However, in vivo efficacy and toxicity studies of TEG011 are still limited. Therefore, we extend the efficacy and toxicity studies as well as the dynamics of TEG011 in vivo in a humanized HLA-A*24:02 transgenic NSG (NSG-A24:02) mouse model to allow the preparation of a first-in-men clinical safety package for adoptive transfer of TEG011. Mice treated with TEG011 did not exhibit any graft-versus-host disease-like symptoms and extensive analysis of pathologic changes in NSG-A24:02 mice did not show any off-target toxicity of TEG011. However, loss of persistence of TEG011 in tumor-bearing mice was associated with the outgrowth of extramedullary tumor masses as also observed for mock-treated mice. In conclusion, TEG011 is well tolerated without harming HLA-A*24:02+ expressing healthy tissues, and TEG011 persistence seems to be crucial for long-term tumor control in vivo.},

  abstract = {Classical approaches to immunotherapy that show promise in some malignancies have generally been disappointing when applied to high-grade brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We recently showed that ex vivo expanded/activated {$\gamma\delta$} T cells recognize NKG2D ligands expressed on malignant glioma and are cytotoxic to glioma cell lines and primary GBM explants. In addition, {$\gamma\delta$} T cells extend survival and slow tumor progression when administered to immunodeficient mice with intracranial human glioma xenografts. We now show that temozolomide (TMZ), a principal chemotherapeutic agent used to treat GBM, increases the expression of stress-associated NKG2D ligands on TMZ-resistant glioma cells, potentially rendering them vulnerable to {$\gamma\delta$} T cell recognition and lysis. TMZ is also highly toxic to {$\gamma\delta$} T cells, however, and to overcome this cytotoxic effect {$\gamma\delta$} T cells were genetically modified using a lentiviral vector encoding the DNA repair enzyme O(6)-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) from the O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) cDNA, which confers resistance to TMZ. Genetic modification of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells did not alter their phenotype or their cytotoxicity against GBM target cells. Importantly, gene modified {$\gamma\delta$} T cells showed greater cytotoxicity to two TMZ resistant GBM cell lines, U373TMZ-R and SNB-19TMZ-R cells, in the presence of TMZ than unmodified cells, suggesting that TMZ exposed more receptors for {$\gamma\delta$} T cell-targeted lysis. Therefore, TMZ resistant {$\gamma\delta$} T cells can be generated without impairing their anti-tumor functions in the presence of high concentrations of TMZ. These results provide a mechanistic basis for combining chemotherapy and {$\gamma\delta$} T cell-based drug resistant cellular immunotherapy to treat GBM.},

  abstract = {{$\gamma\delta$} T cells play uniquely important roles in stress surveillance and immunity for infections and carcinogenesis. Human {$\gamma\delta$} T cells recognize and kill transformed cells independently of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restriction, which is an essential feature of conventional {$\alpha\beta$} T cells. V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 {$\gamma\delta$} T cells, which prevail in the peripheral blood of healthy adults, are activated by microbial or endogenous tumor-derived pyrophosphates by a mechanism dependent on butyrophilin molecules. {$\gamma\delta$} T cells expressing other T cell receptor variable genes, notably V{$\delta$}1, are more abundant in mucosal tissue. In addition to the T cell receptor, {$\gamma\delta$} T cells usually express activating natural killer (NK) receptors, such as NKp30, NKp44, or NKG2D which binds to stress-inducible surface molecules that are absent on healthy cells but are frequently expressed on malignant cells. Therefore, {$\gamma\delta$} T cells are endowed with at least two independent recognition systems to sense tumor cells and to initiate anticancer effector mechanisms, including cytokine production and cytotoxicity. In view of their HLA-independent potent antitumor activity, there has been increasing interest in translating the unique potential of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells into innovative cellular cancer immunotherapies. Here, we discuss recent developments to enhance the efficacy of {$\gamma\delta$} T cell-based immunotherapy. This includes strategies for in vivo activation and tumor-targeting of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells, the optimization of in vitro expansion protocols, and the development of gene-modified {$\gamma\delta$} T cells. It is equally important to consider potential synergisms with other therapeutic strategies, notably checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, or the (local) activation of innate immunity.},

Butyrophilin-3A1 (BTN3A1), a protein structurally related to the B7 family of costimulatory molecules, is necessary but insufficient for this process. We performed radiation hybrid screens to uncover direct TCR ligands and cofactors that~potentiate BTN3A1's P-Ag sensing function. These experiments identified butyrophilin-2A1 (BTN2A1) as essential to V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cell recognition. BTN2A1 synergised with BTN3A1 in sensitizing P-Ag-exposed cells for V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 TCR-mediated responses. Surface plasmon resonance experiments established V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 TCRs used germline-encoded V{$\gamma$}9 regions to directly bind the BTN2A1 CFG-IgV domain surface.~Notably, somatically recombined CDR3 loops implicated in P-Ag recognition were uninvolved. Immunoprecipitations demonstrated close cell-surface BTN2A1-BTN3A1 association independent of P-Ag stimulation. Thus, BTN2A1 is a BTN3A1-linked co-factor critical to V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 TCR recognition. Furthermore, these results suggest a composite-ligand model of P-Ag sensing wherein the V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 TCR directly interacts with both BTN2A1 and an additional ligand recognized in a CDR3-dependent manner.},

In this study, we conducted a phase I/II clinical trial of the adoptive transfer of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells to patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. Eleven patients who had undergone nephrectomy and had lung metastasis were enrolled. Peripheral blood {$\gamma\delta$} T cells obtained from the patients were stimulated ex vivo with 2-methyl-3-butenyl-1-pyrophosphate (2M3B1PP), a synthetic pyrophosphomonoester antigen, and transferred in combination with zoledronic acid (Zol) and teceleukin (recombinant human interleukin-2). Expanded {$\gamma\delta$} T cells exhibited potent cytotoxic activity against tumor cells in vitro, and the proportion of peripheral blood {$\gamma\delta$} T cells among CD3(+) cells typically peaked three to 5~days after transfer. Tumor doubling time was prolonged in all 11 patients, and the best overall responses were 1 CR, 5 SD, and 5 PD, as defined based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Although ten patients developed adverse reactions of grade {$\geq$}3, they were likely to have been the result of the concomitant infusion of Zol and IL-2, and most symptoms swiftly reverted to normal during the course of treatment. In conclusion, this clinical trial demonstrated that our regimen for the adoptive transfer of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells in combination with Zol and IL-2 was well tolerated and that objective clinical responses could be achieved in some patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.},

Although successful, this approach comes with challenges including associated toxicities, risk of relapse, high production costs and a requirement to gene edit cells to avoid graft vs host disease (GvHD) risk if the therapy is to be used in an allogeneic setting. In contrast to {$\alpha\beta$} T cells, human V{$\delta$}1 {$\gamma\delta$} T cells are a subset of T cells defined by expression of heterodimeric T cell receptors (TCRs) composed of a {$\gamma$} chain paired to a V{$\delta$}1 chain. V{$\delta$}1 {$\gamma\delta$} T cell function is highly differentiated from {$\alpha\beta$} T cells, as target cell recognition is not MHC restricted and {$\gamma\delta$} T cells are not alloreactive. Allogeneic matching of patients is therefore not required for V{$\delta$}1 {$\gamma\delta$} T cell therapeutic approaches. Instead V{$\delta$}1 T cells elicit direct anti-tumour responses via activation of diverse receptor repertoires that recognise multiple ligands upregulated on the surface of transformed cells. These key features of V{$\delta$}1 T cell biology therefore confer several advantages when generating an allogeneic cell therapy platform. We have developed a good manufacturing practice (GMP) compliant, scalable process to generate {$\alpha\beta$} T cell depleted, {$\gamma\delta$} T cell cultures (93.5\% {$\pm$} 3.7 of live), enriched for V{$\delta$}1 T cells (67.9\% {$\pm$} 2.2\% of live). The cryopreserved therapeutic product shows good recoverability and proliferation after thawing, an activated innate phenotype and produces high levels of IFN{$\gamma$} and chemokines which can stimulate activation of other cells of the immune system. Post-thaw, V{$\delta$}1 T cell product has cytotoxic activity against a variety of malignant leukaemia and lymphoma cells in vitro and the cells home to the bone marrow and mediate anti-tumour activity following IV dosing in an in vivo xenograft model. Importantly, V{$\delta$}1 T cells have a good safety profile and do not mediate; cytotoxic activity against healthy tissues, mixed lymphocyte reactions or GvHD in in vivo models. Building on our expertise for expanding V{$\delta$}1 T cells, we have now developed scalable transient and stable gene engineering platforms for the generation of V{$\delta$}1 T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) and other molecules. Genetically engineered cells show good expansion kinetics and recoverability and viability post-cryopreservation. The cells also maintain a favourable activated phenotype post-thaw characterised by high levels of expression of CD27, NCR receptors (DNAM1, NKG2D and NKp30) and stable CAR expression at the cell surface. We have now used the V{$\delta$}1 CAR-T platform to develop and screen CAR constructs designed to generate allogeneic CAR-T cell therapies that exploit the unique safety and activity profile of V{$\delta$}1 T cells while additionally potentiating on-target tumour cell killing. Using this approach and tool constructs containing CARs targeting CD19, we have demonstrated potent and enhanced killing of a B-cell tumour cell line without eliciting on-target bystander killing of healthy B cells. In addition, the V{$\delta$}1 CAR-T anti-tumour activity is not associated with release of cytokines that may potentiate off-target toxicities. These data demonstrate that V{$\delta$}1 T cells have the potential to provide a unique CAR-T platform capable of targeting a broader cancer antigen profile than is possible for conventional CAR-T therapies.

Since the impact of factors, such as the relatively low abundance of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells within tumor tissue is still under investigation, it remains to be shown whether these effector T cells can provide significant efficacy against solid tumors.

Over the past 20 years, structurally focused investigations into this MHC-restricted response have provided profound insights into T cell function. Simultaneously, two models of TCR recognition have emerged, centred on whether the TCR has, through evolution, acquired an intrinsic germline-encoded capacity for MHC recognition or whether MHC reactivity is conferred by developmental selection of TCRs. Here, we review the structural and functional data that pertain to these theories of TCR recognition, which indicate that it will be necessary to assimilate features of both models to fully account for the molecular drivers of this evolutionarily ancient interaction between the TCR and MHC molecules.},

For therapeutic purposes camelid-derived variable domain of heavy-chain-only antibodies (VHH) have multiple advantages over mAbs because they are small, stable and have low immunogenicity. Here, we generated 21 human CD1d-specific VHH by immunizing Lama glama and subsequent phage display. Two clones induced maturation of dendritic cells, one clone induced early apoptosis in CD1d-expressing B lymphoblasts and multiple myeloma cells, and another clone blocked recognition of glycolipid-loaded CD1d by CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells. In contrast to reported CD1d-specific mAbs, these CD1d-specific VHH have the unique characteristic that they induce specific and well-defined biological effects. This feature, combined with the above-indicated general advantages of VHH, make the CD1d-specific VHH generated here unique and useful tools to exploit both CD1d ligation as well as disruption of CD1d-iNKT interactions in the treatment of cancer or inflammatory disorders.},

We describe how single-domain antibodies (VHH), specific for the human MHC class I-like molecule CD1d, can modulate the function of CD1d-restricted T cells and how one VHH (1D12) specifically induced strong type I natural killer T (NKT) cell activation. The crystal structure of the VHH1D12-CD1d({$\alpha$}-GalCer)-NKT T-cell receptor (TCR) complex revealed that VHH1D12 simultaneously contacted CD1d and the type I NKT TCR, thereby stabilizing this interaction through intrinsic bispecificity. This led to greatly enhanced type I NKT cell-mediated antitumor activity in in vitro, including multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia patient-derived bone marrow samples, and in vivo models. Our findings underscore the versatility of VHH molecules in targeting composite epitopes, in this case consisting of a complexed monomorphic antigen-presenting molecule and an invariant TCR, and represent a generalizable antitumor approach.},

  abstract = {Abstract:Here we report for the first time on long term follow-up data of a cohort of 60 patients who received TCR{$\alpha\beta$} and CD19 depleted peripheral blood stem cell grafts from haploidentical family donors within a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, phase I/II clinical study (EudraCT No.: 2011-005562-38).As planned, 30 pediatric and 30 adult patients were enrolled in this trial: All patients received a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine (160 mg/m2), thiotepa (10 mg/kg), melphalan (140 mg/m2) and either antithymocyte globulin (Grafalon, 15 or 30 mg/kg, N=53) or 7 Gy total nodal irradiation (N=7). MMF (40 mg/kg/day) was administered as single-agent GVHD prophylaxis until Day 30.Results:Sixty patients with a median age of 18.5 years (range 1-63) were treated. Twenty-five patients had AML, 17 ALL, 6 MDS/MPS and 1 each had multiple myeloma and acute undifferentiated leukemia. Six patients had solid tumors (soft tissue sarcomas and neuroblastomas) and 4 non-malignant disorders (SCID, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, lysosomal storage disorder and sickle cell anemia). Of the 56 patients with malignant disease, 33 were transplanted in complete (CR), 11 in partial (PR) and 12 in non-remission (NR). Twenty of the 56 patients with malignant diseases received a 2nd or 3rd transplantation within this protocol.In total, 88 depletion procedures were performed with the CliniMACS plus System (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) at 7 GMP laboratories and resulted in a median T and B cell log depletion of 4.7 (range 3.6-5.3) and 3.4 (range: 2.3-4.5), respectively. The median number of infused CD34+ cells and TCR{$\alpha\beta$} T cells was 12.4 \texttimes{} 106 /kg BW (range 4.0 - 54.9) and 1.4\texttimes{} 104 /kg BW (range 0.06-6.4), respectively.Engraftment was rapid with a median of 13 (range 9-41) and 15 (11-38) days to reach ANC \&gt;500 cell/\textmu l and PLT \&gt; 20,000 cells/\textmu l. Nine patients rejected the graft. Eight of them were successfully re-transplanted and 1 patient died. One patient received stem cell boosts from the original donor due to poor graft function.On day 100, peripheral T cell chimerism was completely donor-type in 44 of 47 evaluable patients, and mixed in 3.None of the patients developed grade III/IV aGVHD and only 6 patients (10\%) had grade II aGVHD. Of 47 evaluable patients 4 had severe cGVHD (9\%), and 6 (13\%) and 5 (11\%) had moderate and mild cGVHD, respectively.CMV reactivation was seen in 25 (42\%) mainly adult patients, and only 1 (2\%) patient developed disease. Twenty-one (35\%) patients had ADV reactivation and 7 children and 1 adult (13\%) developed disease. Only 1 case of EBV disease (encephalitis) occurred (2\%).A median of 221 (range 8-1230) CD3+ cells/\textmu l was reached on day 100. The median numbers of CD3/CD4+ and CD3/CD8+ cells at 1 year post transplant were 316 (range 1-1173) and 308 (range 0-2203) /\textmu l.As of July 15 2018, 57 patients have completed the 2 year follow-up, died or discontinued the study resulting in a median follow-up of 706 days (range 18-800). 37 patients (62\%) are alive and 23 (38\%) died. Relapse was the major cause of death (N=12) followed by ADV infection (N=3), ARDS (N=3) and 1 case each of cardiac arrest, multi organ failure, sepsis due to graft failure and demyelinating neuropathy. Cause of death was not reported in 1 patient. Eight of the 20 patients who received the 2nd or 3rd transplantation are alive; 1 discontinued the study prematurely. Of the 23 patients transplanted in PR or NR, 13 are alive.The Kaplan-Meier estimated probabilities of overall survival, disease-free survival (DFS) were 62\% and 53\%, respectively. Cumulative incidences of relapse and NRM at 2 years were 34\% and 20\%, respectively. For those patients with leukemia receiving a first SCT in CR, the overall survival, DFS and relapse rate were 75\%, 64\% and 20\%, respectively.Conclusion:The transplantation of TCR{$\alpha\beta$} and CD19 depleted haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell grafts was safe and feasible. Decentralized production using the CliniMACS System was feasible and reliably resulted in grafts containing sufficient numbers of stem cells with only minimal numbers of co-infused TCR{$\alpha\beta$} T cells. None of the patients developed grade III-IV aGVHD and incidence of cGVHD was acceptable. Given the heterogeneous patient cohort with respect to age, disease, remission status and number of previous transplants, the outcome of patients after 2 years follow-up is promising.Lang:Miltenyi Biotec: Patents \&amp; Royalties, Research Funding.

  abstract = {Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is clinically highly aggressive as a result of evolutionary dynamics induced by cross-talk between cancer cells and a heterogeneous group of immune cells in tumor microenvironment. The brain harbors limited numbers of immune cells with few lymphocytes and macrophages; thus, innate-like lymphocytes, such as {$\gamma\delta$} T cells, have important roles in antitumor immunity. Here, we characterized GBM-infiltrating {$\gamma\delta$} T cells, which may have roles in regulating the GBM tumor microenvironment and cancer cell gene expression. V(D)J repertoires of tumor-infiltrating and blood-circulating {$\gamma\delta$} T cells from four patients were analyzed by next-generation sequencing-based T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing in addition to mutation and immune profiles in four GBM cases. In all tumor tissues, abundant innate and effector/memory lymphocytes were detected, accompanied by large numbers of tumor-associated macrophages and closely located tumor-infiltrating {$\gamma\delta$} T cells, which appear to have anti-tumor activity. The immune-related gene expression analysis using the TCGA database showed that the signature gene expression extent of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells were more associated with those of cytotoxic T and Th1 cells and M1 macrophages than those of Th2 cells and M2 macrophages. Although the most abundant {$\gamma\delta$} T cells were V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells in both tumor tissues and blood, the repertoire of intratumoral V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells was distinct from that of peripheral blood V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells and was dominated by V{$\gamma$}9J{$\gamma$}2 sequences, not by canonical V{$\gamma$}9J{$\gamma$}P sequences that are mostly commonly found in blood {$\gamma\delta$} T cells. Collectively, unique GBM-specific TCR clonotypes were identified by comparing TCR repertoires of peripheral blood and intra-tumoral {$\gamma\delta$} T cells. These findings will be helpful for the elucidation of tumor-specific antigens and development of anticancer immunotherapies using tumor-infiltrating {$\gamma\delta$} T cells.},

  abstract = {{$\gamma\delta$} T cells possess cytotoxic antitumor activity mediated by production of proinflammatory cytokines, direct cytotoxic activity, and regulation of the biological functions of other cell types. Hence, these features have prompted the development of therapeutic strategies in which {$\gamma\delta$} T cells agonists or ex vivo-expanded {$\gamma\delta$} T cells are administered to tumor patients. Several studies have shown that {$\gamma\delta$} T cells are an important component of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients affected by different types of cancer and a recent analysis of \textasciitilde 18,000 transcriptomes from 39 human tumors identified tumor-infiltrating {$\gamma\delta$} T cells as the most significant favorable cancer-wide prognostic signature. However, the complex and intricate interactions between tumor cells, tumor microenvironment (TME), and tumor-infiltrating immune cells results in a balance between tumor-promoting and tumor-controlling effects, and {$\gamma\delta$} T cells functions are often diverted or impaired by immunosuppressive signals originating from the TME. This review focuses on the dangerous liason between {$\gamma\delta$} T cells and tumoral microenvironment and raises the possibility that strategies capable to reduce the immunosuppressive environment and increase the cytotoxic ability of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells may be the key factor to improve their utilization in tumor immunotherapy.},

However, the exact influence of B7-H3 on the features and antitumor ability of {$\gamma\delta$}T cells in colon cancer remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated that the proportions of B7-H3+ {$\gamma\delta$}T cells were distinctly increased in the peripheral blood and tumor tissues of colon cancer patients. B7-H3 blockade or knockdown promoted proliferation, inhibited cell apoptosis and induced the expression of activation markers (CD25 and CD69) on V{$\delta$}2~T cells. In contrast, treatment with the B7-H3 agonist 4H7 had the opposite effect. Furthermore, B7-H3 suppressed IFN-{$\gamma$} expression by inhibiting T-bet in V{$\delta$}2~T cells. Moreover, B7-H3 mediated the inhibition of V{$\delta$}2~T cell cytotoxicity via the downregulation of IFN-{$\gamma$} and perforin/granzyme B expression. More importantly, blocking the B7-H3 function significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of V{$\delta$}2~T cells against colon cancer cells in vivo. Therefore, the inhibition or blockade of B7-H3 is a potential immunotherapeutic approach for colon cancer.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Patients with relapsed pediatric solid tumors and CNS malignancies have few therapeutic options and frequently die of their disease. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown tremendous success in treating relapsed pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but this has not yet translated to treating solid tumors. This is partially due to a paucity of differentially expressed cell surface molecules on solid tumors that can be safely targeted. Here, we present B7-H3 (CD276) as a putative target for CAR T-cell therapy of pediatric solid tumors, including those arising in the central nervous system. Experimental Design: We developed a novel B7-H3 CAR whose binder is derived from a mAb that has been shown to preferentially bind tumor tissues and has been safely used in humans in early-phase clinical trials. We tested B7-H3 CAR T cells in a variety of pediatric cancer models. Results: B7-H3 CAR T cells mediate significant antitumor activity in vivo, causing regression of established solid tumors in xenograft models including osteosarcoma, medulloblastoma, and Ewing sarcoma. We demonstrate that B7-H3 CAR T-cell efficacy is largely dependent upon high surface target antigen density on tumor tissues and that activity is greatly diminished against target cells that express low levels of antigen, thus providing a possible therapeutic window despite low-level normal tissue expression of B7-H3. Conclusions: B7-H3 CAR T cells could represent an exciting therapeutic option for patients with certain lethal relapsed or refractory pediatric malignancies, and should be tested in carefully designed clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Major limitations of currently investigated {$\alpha\beta$}T cells redirected against cancer by transfer of tumor-specific {$\alpha\beta$}TCR arise from their low affinity, MHC restriction, and risk to mediate self-reactivity after pairing with endogenous {$\alpha$} or {$\beta$}TCR chains. Therefore, the ability of a defined {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2TCR to redirect {$\alpha\beta$}T cells selectively against tumor cells was tested and its molecular interaction with a variety of targets investigated. Functional analysis revealed that a {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2TCR efficiently reprograms both CD4(+) and CD8(+) {$\alpha\beta$}T cells against a broad panel of cancer cells while ignoring normal cells, and substantially reduces but does not completely abrogate alloreactivity. {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2TCR-transduced {$\alpha\beta$}T cells reduced colony formation of progenitor cells of primary acute myeloid leukemia blasts and inhibited leukemia growth in a humanized mouse model. Thereby, metabolites of a dysregulated mevalonate pathway are targeted and the additional application of widely used biphosphonates is crucial for in vivo efficacy most likely because of its modulating effect on cytokine secretion of {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2TCR-transduced {$\alpha\beta$}T cells. Expression of NKG2D ligands and F1-ATPase contributed to the activity of {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2TCR-transduced {$\alpha\beta$}T cells but were not mandatory. In summary, {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2 TCRs are an attractive alternative to broadly redirect {$\alpha\beta$}T cells against cancer cells with both an improved efficacy and safety profile compared with currently used {$\alpha\beta$}TCRs.},

  abstract = {Relapse after conventional chemotherapy remains a major problem in patients with myeloid malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and the major cause of death after diagnosis of AML is from relapsed disease. The only potentially curative treatment option currently available is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), which through its graft-vs.-leukemia effects has the ability to eliminate residual leukemia cells. Despite its long history of success however, relapse following allo-HSCT is still a major challenge and is associated with poor prognosis. In the field of adoptive therapy, CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have yielded remarkable clinical success in certain types of B-cell malignancies, and substantial efforts aimed at translating this success to myeloid malignancies are currently underway. While complete ablation of CD19-expressing B cells, both cancerous and healthy, is clinically tolerated, the primary challenge limiting the use of CAR T cells in myeloid malignancies is the absence of a dispensable antigen, as myeloid antigens are often co-expressed on normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), depletion of which would lead to intolerable myeloablation. This review provides a discussion on the current state of CAR T cell therapy in myeloid malignancies, limitations for clinical translation, as well as the most recent approaches to overcome these barriers, through various genetic modification and combinatorial strategies in an attempt to make CAR T cell therapy a safe and viable option for patients with myeloid malignancies.},

In 2019, the cellular therapy module of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) registry received a positive qualification opinion from the EMA indicating that the registry fulfills the essential needs to capture such data. We investigated its broader implication. RECENT FINDINGS: Since 2020, the cellular therapy module of the EBMT registry captures data to support postauthorization studies for MAHs and EMA. The process toward a positive qualification opinion has attracted interest from many other stakeholders, such as scientists and Health Technology Assessment bodies, and was the spin-off for a stimulating development which defined the need for a registry to comply with regulatory requirements, and also inspired ways to deal with CAR-T cell programs in terms of center qualifications and educational standards for professionals. SUMMARY: The positive qualified opinion of the EBMT registry by EMA to monitor long-term efficacy and safety of commercial CAR-T cells created opportunities and challenges and was serving as linking-pin to launch a novel CAR-T cell community.},

This study uses gamma delta T-cells to maximize the anti-tumor response and minimize graft versus host disease (GVHD) in leukemic and myelodysplastic patients who have had a partially mismatched bone marrow transplant (haploidentical). Detailed Description: Many patients with hematological malignancies require a bone marrow transplant for curative treatment. A matched sibling donor is optimal but may not be available. Therefore, a partially matched family member (haploidentical) may be a viable alternative. The incidence of graft vs. host disease, however, can become more of a significant, even fatal, factor with partial matches. T-cells have been shown to be the key player in the post-transplant immune phenomena. The majority of T-cells are composed of alpha beta T-cells with a small minority of gamma delta T-cells, which are known to have the unique ability to kill malignant cells without antigen recognition. This study proposes to extract, concentrate, and activate gamma delta T-cells from the peripheral blood to provide innate anti-tumor effect with minimal risk of GVHD. Safety and impact and/or the rate of GVHD will be evaluated.},

On the one hand, clonally expanded {$\gamma\delta$} T cells with unique specificities typify adaptive immunity. Conversely, large compartments of {$\gamma\delta$}TCR+ intraepithelial lymphocytes ({$\gamma\delta$} IELs) exhibit limited TCR diversity and effect rapid, innate-like tissue surveillance. The development of several {$\gamma\delta$} IEL compartments depends on epithelial expression of genes encoding butyrophilin-like (Btnl (mouse) or BTNL (human)) members of the B7 superfamily of T cell co-stimulators. Here we found that responsiveness to Btnl or BTNL proteins was mediated by germline-encoded motifs within the cognate TCR variable {$\gamma$}-chains (V{$\gamma$} chains) of mouse and human {$\gamma\delta$} IELs. This was in contrast to diverse antigen recognition by clonally restricted complementarity-determining regions CDR1-CDR3 of the same {$\gamma\delta$}TCRs. Hence, the {$\gamma\delta$}TCR intrinsically combines innate immunity and adaptive immunity by using spatially distinct regions to discriminate non-clonal agonist-selecting elements from clone-specific ligands. The broader implications for antigen-receptor biology are considered.},

In nearly all studies to date, T cells bearing {$\alpha\beta$} receptors have been used to generate CAR T cells. In this review, we highlight biological characteristics of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells that are distinct from those of {$\alpha\beta$} T cells, including homing to epithelial and mucosal tissues and unique functions such as direct antigen recognition, lack of alloreactivity, and ability to present antigens. We offer our perspective that these features make {$\gamma\delta$} T cells promising for use in cellular therapy against several types of solid tumors, including melanoma and gastrointestinal cancers.

  abstract = {Most studies on genetic engineering technologies for cancer immunotherapy based on allogeneic donors have focused on adaptive immunity. However, the main limitation of such approaches is that they can lead to severe graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). An alternative approach would bolster innate immunity by relying on the natural tropism of some subsets of the innate immune system, such as {$\gamma\delta$} T and natural killer (NK) cells, for the tumor microenvironment and their ability to kill in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-independent manner. {$\gamma\delta$} T and NK cells have the unique ability to bridge innate and adaptive immunity while responding to a broad range of tumors. Considering these properties, {$\gamma\delta$} T and NK cells represent ideal sources for developing allogeneic cell therapies. Recently, significant efforts have been made to exploit the intrinsic anti-tumor capacity of these cells for treating hematologic and solid malignancies using genetic engineering approaches such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and T cell receptor (TCR). Here, we review over 30 studies on these two approaches that use {$\gamma\delta$} T and NK cells in adoptive cell therapy (ACT) for treating cancer. Based on those studies, we propose several promising strategies to optimize the clinical translation of these approaches.},

We also describe the experience to date of {$\gamma\delta$}T lymphocytes in immunotherapy for breast cancer and suggest the direction of work going forward, particularly as regards different breast cancer subtypes.},

On Arm A of the study, research participants will receive B7H3-specific CAR T cells only. On Arm B of the study, research participants will receive CAR T cells directed at B7H3 and CD19, a marker on the surface of B lymphocytes, following the hypothesis that CD19+ B cells serving in their normal role as antigen presenting cells to T cells will promote the expansion and persistence of the CAR T cells. Arm A CAR T cells include the protein EGFRt and Arm B CAR T cells include the protein HER2tG. These proteins can be used to both track and destroy the CAR T cells in case of undue toxicity. The primary objectives of the study will be to determine the feasibility of manufacturing the cell products, the safety of the T cell product infusion, to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the CAR T cells products, to describe the full toxicity profile of each product, and determine the persistence of the modified cell in the participant's body on each arm. Participants will receive a single dose of T cells comprised of two different subtypes of T cells (CD4 and CD8 T cells) felt to benefit one another once administered to the research participants for improved potential therapeutic effect. The secondary objectives of this protocol are to study the number of modified cells in the patients and the duration they continue to be at detectable levels. The investigators will also quantitate anti-tumor efficacy on each arm. Participants who experience significant and potentially life-threatening toxicities (other than clinically manageable toxicities related to T cells working, called cytokine release syndrome) will receive infusions of cetuximab (an antibody commercially available that targets EGFRt) or trastuzumab (an antibody commercially available that targets HER2tG) to assess the ability of the EGFRt on the T cells to be an effective suicide mechanism for the elimination of the transferred T cell products.},

Trends in donor choice seen before continue, with growing numbers of haploidentical HCT and decreasing use of cord blood. Of interest is that after many years of continued growth, the number of patients receiving an allogeneic HCT for marrow failure is decreasing slightly (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Such a change may be explained by the use of thrombopoietin analogs in aplastic anemia patients. Other nonmalignant indications, however continue to grow, most importantly HCT for hemoglobinopathies by 36\%, equally for thalassemias and sickle cell disease. Non-HCT cell therapies have increased by 28\% since 2015 and genetically modified T cells is type of cell therapy with the fastest growth.

In addition, other immune cells-from both the innate and adaptive compartments-are in various stages of clinical application. In this review, we focus on these non-CAR T cell immunotherapeutic approaches for malignancy. The first section describes engineering T cells to express non-CAR constructs, and the second section describes other gene-modified cells used to target malignancy. Conclusions: CAR T cell therapies have demonstrated the clinical benefits of harnessing our body's own defenses to combat tumor cells. Similar research is being conducted on lesser known modifications and gene-modified immune cells, which we highlight in this review.},

The major gamma delta T cell subset in human beings is designated V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 and is activated by intermediates of isoprenoid biosynthesis or aminobisphosphonate inhibitors of farnesyldiphosphate synthase. Activated cells are potent for killing a broad range of tumor cells and demonstrated the capacity for tumor reduction in murine xenotransplant tumor models.

  abstract = {Important progress has been registered in the last years in the treatment of patients suffering from oncological/haematological malignancies, but more still needs to be done to reduce toxicity and side-effects, improve outcome and offer new strategies for relapsed or refractory disease. A remarkable part of these clinical benefits is due to advances in immunotherapy. Here, we investigate the generation of a novel, universal and ready-to-use immunotherapeutic product based on {$\gamma\delta$}-T lymphocytes. These cells are part of the innate immune system exerting potent natural cytotoxicity against bacteria, viruses and tumours. This ability, coupled with their negligible alloreactivity, makes them attractive for adoptive immunotherapy approaches. To achieve a cell product suitable for clinical use, we developed a strategy capable to generate polyclonal {$\gamma\delta$}-T cells with predominant memory-V{$\delta$}1 phenotype and the additional possibility of gene-modification in good manufacturing practice (GMP) procedures. We expand clinically relevant numbers of functional polyclonal memory {$\gamma\delta$}-T cells under GMP conditions, with the additional possibility of gene-modification to improve anti-tumour activity. Irradiated engineered artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) expressing CD86/41BBL/CD40L and the cytomegalovirus (CMV)-antigen-pp65 have been used. The presence of CMV-pp65 and CD40L proved to be crucial for expansion of the memory-V{$\delta$}1 subpopulation. To allow clinical translation and guarantee patient safety, aAPCs were stably transduced with an inducible suicide gene. Expanded {$\gamma\delta$}-T cells showed high expression of activation and memory markers without signs of exhaustion, maintained polyclonality and potent anti-tumour activity both in vitro (with immortalized and primary blasts) and in vivo studies without allo-reactivity events. The molecular characterization (phophoproteomic and gene-expression) of these cell products underlines their unique properties. These cells can further be armed with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) to improve anti-tumour capacity and persistence. We demonstrate the feasibility of establishing an allogeneic third-party, off-the-shelf and ready-to-use, {$\gamma\delta$}-T-cell bank. They represent an attractive therapeutic option endowed with broad clinical applications, including treatment of viral infections in highly immunocompromised patients by the presence of the memory V{$\delta$}1-subset, treatment of aggressive malignancies refractory to conventional approaches, bridging therapy to more targeted immunotherapeutic approaches and, ultimately, an innovative platform for the development of off-the-shelf CAR-T-cell products.},

  abstract = {Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has been shown to be dramatically effective in the treatment of B-cell malignancies. However, there are still substantial obstacles to overcome, before similar responses can be achieved in patients with solid tumors. We evaluated both in vitro and in a preclinical murine model the efficacy of different 2nd and 3rd generation CAR constructs targeting GD2, a disial-ganglioside expressed on the surface of neuroblastoma (NB) tumor cells. In order to address potential safety concerns regarding clinical application, an inducible safety switch, namely inducible Caspase-9 (iC9), was also included in the vector constructs. Our data indicate that a 3rd generation CAR incorporating CD28.4-1BB costimulatory domains is associated with improved anti-tumor efficacy as compared with a CAR incorporating the combination of CD28.OX40 domains. We demonstrate that the choice of 4-1BB signaling results into significant amelioration of several CAR T-cell characteristics, including: 1) T-cell exhaustion, 2) basal T-cell activation, 3) in vivo tumor control and 4) T-cell persistence. The fine-tuning of T-cell culture conditions obtained using IL7 and IL15 was found to be synergic with the CAR.GD2 design in increasing the anti-tumor activity of CAR T cells. We also demonstrate that activation of the suicide gene iC9, included in our construct without significantly impairing neither CAR expression nor anti-tumor activity, leads to a prompt induction of apoptosis of GD2.CAR T cells. Altogether, these findings are instrumental in optimizing the function of CAR T-cell products to be employed in the treatment of children with NB.},

To assess the potential of human gammadelta T cells to serve as effector cells of specific anti-tumour immunity, we expanded peripheral blood-derived gammadelta T cells and transduced them with recombinant retrovirus encoding G(D2)- or CD19-specific chimaeric receptors. Flow cytometric analysis of T cells from four individual donors cultured in the presence of zoledronate at day 14 of culture showed selective enrichment of the gammadelta T cell population (Vgamma9(+) Vdelta2(+) CD3(+) CD4(-) CD8(-)) to 73-96\% of total CD3(+) T cells. Retroviral gene transfer resulted in chimaeric receptor surface expression in 73 +/- 12\% of the population. Transduced gammadelta T cells efficiently recognized antigen-expressing tumour cell targets, as demonstrated by target-specific upregulation of CD69 and secretion of interferon-alpha. Moreover, transduced gammadelta T cells efficiently and specifically lysed the antigen-expressing tumour targets. They could be efficiently expanded in vitro and maintained in culture for prolonged periods. Zoledronate-activated human gammadelta T cells expressing chimaeric receptors may thus serve as potent and specific anti-tumour effector cells. Their responsiveness to stimulation with aminobisphosphonates may enable the selective re-expansion of adoptively transferred T cells in vivo, permitting long lasting anti-tumour immune control.},

  abstract = {Simple Summary Certain immune cells, namely T cells, of cancer patients can be genetically manipulated to express so-called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), which enables these cells to kill the tumor cells after recognition by the receptor. This therapy is very successful in the treatment of hematologic tumors such as lymphoma or leukemia. However, tumors growing as a solid mass are less susceptible to this kind of treatment. This review summarizes known data of all clinical trials using this therapy against solid tumors that are registered at clinicaltrials.gov. Abstract CAR-T cells showed great potential in the treatment of patients with hematologic tumors. However, the clinical efficacy of CAR-T cells against solid tumors lags behind. To obtain a comprehensive overview of the landscape of CAR-T cell clinical trials against this type of cancer, this review summarizes all the 196 studies registered at clinicaltrials.gov. Special focus is on: (1) geographical distribution; (2) targeted organs, tumor entities, and antigens; (3) CAR transfer methods, CAR formats, and extra features introduced into the T cells; and (4) patient pretreatments, injection sites, and safety measurements. Finally, the few data on clinical outcome are reported. The last assessment of clinicaltrials.gov for the data summarized in this paper was on 4 August 2020.},

Here, we developed an unbiased, genome-wide screening method that identified RhoB as a critical mediator of V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 TCR activation in tumor cells. Our results show that V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 TCR activation is modulated by the GTPase activity of RhoB and its redistribution to BTN3A1. This is associated with cytoskeletal changes that directly stabilize BTN3A1 in the membrane, and the subsequent dissociation of RhoB from BTN3A1. Furthermore, phosphoantigen accumulation induces a conformational change in BTN3A1, rendering its extracellular domains recognizable by V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 TCRs. These complementary events provide further evidence for inside-out signaling as an essential step in~the recognition of tumor cells by a V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 TCR.},

Pancreatic stellate cell (PSC) activation contributes to pancreatic fibrosis in PDAC, limiting the delivery and efficacy of therapeutic agents. Whether {$\gamma\delta$} T cells have direct effects on PSC activation is unknown. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed tumor tissue from 68 patients with PDAC and determined the frequency and location of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. PDAC samples from the TCGA database with low and high TRGC2 expression were correlated with the expression of extracellular matrix genes. Further, PSCs were isolated from pancreatic tumor tissue and co-cultured with {$\gamma\delta$} T cells for 48 hours and cytokine production was measured using a cytometric bead array. RESULTS: {$\gamma\delta$} T cells infiltrated the pancreatic tumor stroma and were located in proximity to PSCs. A high infiltration of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells was associated with increased expression of several extracellular matrix genes in human PDAC. In vitro, {$\gamma\delta$} T cells stimulated IL-6 production by PDAC-derived PSCs. CONCLUSION: {$\gamma\delta$} T cells activated PSCs and modulation of this interaction may enhance the efficacy of combinational therapies in human PDAC.},

Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands are promising adjuvants for cancer immunotherapy, but TLR7/8 ligand Resiquimod has been shown to inhibit CD4 T-cell activation in a monocyte-dependent manner. Therefore, we studied the modulation of human {$\gamma\delta$} T-cell activation by TLR7/8 ligands. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or purified {$\gamma\delta$} T cells together with purified monocytes were stimulated with zoledronic acid or phosphoantigens in the absence or presence of various imidazoquinoline TLR7 or TLR8 agonists. Read-out systems included interferon-{$\gamma$} induction and cellular expansion of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells, as well as viability, cell surface antigen modulation, and IL-1{$\beta$} and TNF-{$\alpha$} production of monocytes. RESULTS: TLR8 ligand TL8-506 and TLR7/8 ligand Resiquimod (but not TLR7 ligands) rapidly induced IFN-{$\gamma$} expression in {$\gamma\delta$} T cells within PBMC, and co-stimulated phosphoantigen-induced IFN-{$\gamma$} expression in {$\gamma\delta$} T cells. On the other hand, TLR8 ligands potently suppressed {$\gamma\delta$} T-cell expansion in response to zoledronic acid and phosphoantigen. Purified monocytes secreted large amounts of IL-1{$\beta$} and TNF-{$\alpha$} when stimulated with TLR8 ligands but simultaneously underwent substantial cell death after 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: TLR8 ligand-activated monocytes potently co-stimulate early {$\gamma\delta$} T-cell activation but failed to provide accessory cell function for in vitro expansion of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells.},

Almost all studies using this modality have focused on transfer of TCR from CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The transfer of TCR from innate lymphocytes to other lymphocytes has not been studied. In the current study, innate and adaptive lymphocytes were transfected with the human NKT cell-derived TCR{$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} chain mRNA (the V{$\alpha$}24 and V{$\beta$}11 TCR chains). When primary T cells transfected with NKT cell-derived TCR were subsequently stimulated with the NKT ligand, {$\alpha$}-galactosylceramide ({$\alpha$}-GalCer), they secreted IFN-{$\gamma$} in a ligand-specific manner. Furthermore when {$\gamma\delta$}T cells were transfected with NKT cell-derived TCR mRNA, they demonstrated enhanced proliferation, IFN-{$\gamma$} production and antitumor effects after {$\alpha$}-GalCer stimulation as compared to parental {$\gamma\delta$}T cells. Importantly, NKT cell TCR-transfected {$\gamma\delta$}T cells responded to both NKT cell and {$\gamma\delta$}T cell ligands, rendering them bi-potential innate lymphocytes. Because NKT cell receptors are unique and universal invariant receptors in humans, the TCR chains do not yield mispaired receptors with endogenous TCR {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} chains after the transfection. The transfection of NKT cell TCR has the potential to be a new approach to tumor immunotherapy in patients with various types of cancer.},

  abstract = {Gamma delta ({$\gamma\delta$}) T cells kill transformed cells, and increased circulating {$\gamma\delta$} T cells levels correlate with improved outcome in cancer patients; however, their function within the breast tumor microenvironment (TME) remains controversial. As tumors progress, they begin to express stem-cell associated proteins, concomitant with the emergence of therapy resistant metastatic disease. For example, invasive breast cancers often secrete the embryonic morphogen, NODAL. NODAL has been shown to promote angiogenesis, therapy resistance and metastasis in breast cancers. However, to date, little is known about how this secreted protein may interact with cells in the TME. Herein we explore how NODAL in the TME may influence {$\gamma\delta$} T cell function. We have assessed the proximity of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells to NODAL in a cohort of triple negative breast tumors. In all cases in which {$\gamma\delta$} T cells could be identified in these tumors, {$\gamma\delta$} T cells were found in close proximity to NODAL-expressing tumor cells. Migration of {$\gamma\delta$} and {$\alpha\beta$} T cells was similar toward MDA-MB-231 cells in which NODAL had been knocked down (shN) and MDA-MB-231 scrambled control cells (shC). Furthermore, V{$\delta$}1 {$\gamma\delta$} T cells did not migrate preferentially toward conditioned medium from these cell lines. While 24-h exposure to NODAL did not impact CD69, PD-1, or T cell antigen receptor (TCR) expression on {$\gamma\delta$} T cells, long term exposure resulted in decreased V{$\delta$}2 TCR expression. Maturation of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells was not significantly influenced by NODAL stimulation. While neither short- nor long-term NODAL stimulation impacted the ability of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells to kill MCF-7 breast cancer cells, the absence of NODAL resulted in greater sensitivity of targets to {$\gamma\delta$} T cell cytotoxicity, while overexpression of NODAL conferred resistance. This appeared to be at least in part due to an inverse correlation between NODAL and surface MICA/B expression on breast cancer target lines. As such, it appears that NODAL may play a role in strategies employed by breast cancer cells to evade {$\gamma\delta$} T cell targeting, and this should be considered in the development of safe and effective {$\gamma\delta$} T cell immunotherapies.},

  abstract = {Interactions between immune and tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) often impact patient outcome, yet remain poorly understood. In addition, the effects of biophysical features such as hypoxia [low oxygen (O2)] on cells within the TME may lead to tumor evasion. Gamma delta T cells ({$\gamma\delta$}Tcs) naturally kill transformed cells and are therefore under development as immunotherapy for various cancers. Clinical trials have proven the safety of {$\gamma\delta$}Tc immunotherapy and increased circulating {$\gamma\delta$}Tc levels correlate with improved patient outcome. Yet, the function of {$\gamma\delta$}Tc tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in human breast cancer remains controversial. Breast tumors can be highly hypoxic, thus therapy must be effective under low O2 conditions. We have found increased infiltration of {$\gamma\delta$}Tc in areas of hypoxia in a small cohort of breast tumors; considering their inherent plasticity, it is important to understand how hypoxia influences {$\gamma\delta$}Tc function. In vitro, the cell density of expanded primary healthy donor blood-derived human {$\gamma\delta$}Tc decreased in response to hypoxia (2\% O2) compared to normoxia (20\% O2). However, the secretion of macrophage inflammatory protein 1{$\alpha$} (MIP1{$\alpha$})/MIP1{$\beta$}, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), and CD40L by {$\gamma\delta$}Tc were increased after 40\,h in hypoxia compared to normoxia concomitant with the stabilization of hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha protein. Mechanistically, we determined that natural killer group 2, member D (NKG2D) on {$\gamma\delta$}Tc and the NKG2D ligand MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA)/B on MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cell lines are important for {$\gamma\delta$}Tc cytotoxicity, but that MIP1{$\alpha$}, RANTES, and CD40L do not play a direct role in cytotoxicity. Hypoxia appeared to enhance the cytotoxicity of {$\gamma\delta$}Tc such that exposure for 48\,h increased cytotoxicity of {$\gamma\delta$}Tc against breast cancer cells that were maintained in normoxia; conversely, breast cancer lines incubated in hypoxia for 48\,h prior to the assay were largely resistant to {$\gamma\delta$}Tc cytotoxicity. MICA/B surface expression on both MCF-7 and T47D remained unchanged upon exposure to hypoxia; however, ELISAs revealed increased MICA shedding by MCF-7 under hypoxia, potentially explaining resistance to {$\gamma\delta$}Tc cytotoxicity. Despite enhanced {$\gamma\delta$}Tc cytotoxicity upon pre-incubation in hypoxia, these cells were unable to overcome hypoxia-induced resistance of MCF-7. Thus, such resistance mechanisms employed by breast cancer targets must be overcome to develop more effective {$\gamma\delta$}Tc immunotherapies.},

  abstract = {Integrins are adhesion receptors on the cell surface that enable cells to respond to their environment. Most integrins are heterodimers, comprising {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} type I transmembrane glycoprotein chains with large extracellular domains and short cytoplasmic tails. Integrins deliver signals through multiprotein complexes at the cell surface, which interact with cytoskeletal and signaling proteins to influence gene expression, cell proliferation, morphology, and migration. Integrin expression on {$\gamma\delta$} T cells ({$\gamma\delta$}Tc) has not been systematically investigated; however, reports in the literature dating back to the early 1990s reveal an understated role for integrins in {$\gamma\delta$}Tc function. Over the years, integrins have been investigated on resting and/or activated peripheral blood-derived polyclonal {$\gamma\delta$}Tc, {$\gamma\delta$}Tc clones, as well as {$\gamma\delta$} T intraepithelial lymphocytes. Differences in integrin expression have been found between {$\alpha\beta$} T cells ({$\alpha\beta$}Tc) and {$\gamma\delta$}Tc, as well as between V{$\delta$}1 and V{$\delta$}2 {$\gamma\delta$}Tc. While most studies have focused on human {$\gamma\delta$}Tc, research has also been carried out in mouse and bovine models. Roles attributed to {$\gamma\delta$}Tc integrins include adhesion, signaling, activation, migration, tissue localization, tissue retention, cell spreading, cytokine secretion, tumor infiltration, and involvement in tumor cell killing. This review attempts to encompass all reports of integrins expressed on {$\gamma\delta$}Tc published prior to December 2017, highlights areas warranting further investigation, and discusses the relevance of integrin expression for {$\gamma\delta$}Tc function.},

  abstract = {When optimizing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy in terms of efficacy, safety, and broadening its application to new malignancies, there are two main clusters of topics to be addressed: the CAR design and the choice of transfected cells. The former focuses on the CAR construct itself. The utilized transmembrane and intracellular domains determine the signaling pathways induced by antigen binding and thereby the cell-specific effector functions triggered. The main part of this review summarizes our understanding of common signaling domains employed in CARs, their interactions among another, and their effects on different cell types. It will, moreover, highlight several less common extracellular and intracellular domains that might permit unique new opportunities. Different antibody-based extracellular antigen-binding domains have been pursued and optimized to strike a balance between specificity, affinity, and toxicity, but these have been reviewed elsewhere. The second cluster of topics is about the cellular vessels expressing the CAR. It is essential to understand the specific attributes of each cell type influencing anti-tumor efficacy, persistence, and safety, and how CAR cells crosstalk with each other and bystander cells. The first part of this review focuses on the progress achieved in adopting different leukocytes for CAR therapy.},

  abstract = {The treatment of haematological malignancies with adoptive cell therapy such as leukaemia is limited to conventional ab T cells transduced at great cost with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) recognising the B-cell associated antigen CD19. Although greatly successful especially in paediatric cases, this therapy remains with its challenges such as associated toxicities, relapse rate as well as high production costs and production failure rates due to its autologous nature, indicated by the high risk of {$\alpha\beta$} T cells inducing sever graft versus host disease (GvHD).In contrast to {$\alpha\beta$} T cells, {$\gamma\delta$} T cells are not restricted to, or recognise major histocompatibility complex (MHC) peptide complexes. Especially V{$\delta$}1 T cells, enriched in human tissues but also found in small numbers in the human blood have been shown to elicit potent anti-tumour responses recognising stress ligands up-regulated on malignant cells, whilst sparing healthy tissue. A study looking at 39 malignancies, solid tumours as well as haematological malignancies, identified the presence of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells as the single most positive correlative factor for overall survival. Even more striking, expanding {$\gamma\delta$} T cells and more specifically V{$\delta$}1 T cells correlate with strong graft versus leukaemia and reduced incident rates of GvHD after {$\alpha\beta$} T cell depleted, haploidentical stem cell transplantation. These correlative findings have been confirmed in several retrospective data-sets but more recently in a prospective study looking at multiple haematological indications such as AML, ALL and MM.We have developed a 2{$\frac{1}{2}$} week, good manufacturing practice (GMP) compliant and scalable ({$\geq$} 1x109) process to consistently generate {$\alpha\beta$} T cell depleted, {$\gamma\delta$} T cell lymphocyte cultures (93.5\% {$\pm$} 3.7 of live), strongly enriched for V{$\delta$}1 T cells (67.9\%{$\pm$}2.2\% of live). V{$\delta$}1 T cells show good recoverability and proliferation in response to cytokines after cryopreservation, kill a variety of malignant leukaemia and myeloma cells at low effector to target ratios (2:1) and show a favourable innate phenotype expressing high levels of the co-stimulatory molecule CD27, CD69 and the natural cytotoxicity receptors NKG2D, DNAM-1 and NKp30. Expression of negative modulators such as PD-1, CTLA4 and TIGIT remain low or non-detectable. V{$\delta$}1 T cells produce large levels of IFN-{$\gamma$}, TNF-{$\alpha$} but little to no IL-17 on activation. Furthermore, large amounts of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CCL2 and CLL5, as well as the antigen-presenting cell attracting chemokine CCL4 additionally to the colony stimulating factors M-CSF and GM-CSF, support the idea of V{$\delta$}1 T cells orchestrating secondary adaptive immune responses after activation. Importantly, and in accordance with their MHC-independent biology, V{$\delta$}1 T cells do not kill healthy lymphocytes or primary tissue-derived stromal cells such as fibroblasts.V{$\delta$}1 T cells derived from healthy blood and generated under GMP conditions constitute a potential 'off-the-shelf', fully allogeneic cell therapy for the treatment of multiple haematological malignancies.Simoes:GammaDelta Therapeutics Ltd.: Employment.

  abstract = {Innate immune cells are active at the front line of host defense against pathogens and now appear to play a range of roles under non-infectious conditions as well, most notably in cancer. Establishing the balance of innate immune responses is critical for the "flavor" of these responses and subsequent adaptive immunity and can be either "good or bad" in controlling cancer progression. The importance of innate NK cells in tumor immune responses has already been extensively studied over the last few decades, but more recently several relatively mono- or oligo-clonal [i.e., (semi-) invariant] innate T cell subsets received substantial interest in tumor immunology including invariant natural killer T (iNKT), {$\gamma\delta$}-T and mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. These subsets produce high levels of various pro- and/or anti-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines reflecting their capacity to suppress or stimulate immune responses. Survival of patients with cancer has been linked to the frequencies and activation status of NK, iNKT, and {$\gamma\delta$}-T cells. It has become clear that NK, iNKT, {$\gamma\delta$}-T as well as MAIT cells all have physiological roles in anti-tumor responses, which emphasize their possible relevance for tumor immunotherapy. A variety of clinical trials has focused on manipulating NK, iNKT, and {$\gamma\delta$}-T cell functions as a cancer immunotherapeutic approach demonstrating their safety and potential for achieving beneficial therapeutic effects, while the exploration of MAIT cell related therapies is still in its infancy. Current issues limiting the full therapeutic potential of these innate cell subsets appear to be related to defects and suppressive properties of these subsets that, with the right stimulus, might be reversed. In general, how innate lymphocytes are activated appears to control their subsequent abilities and consequent impact on adaptive immunity. Controlling these potent regulators and mediators of the immune system should enable their protective roles to dominate and their deleterious potential (in the specific context of cancer) to be mitigated.},

  abstract = {Engagement between the natural killer group 2, member D (NKG2D) receptor and its ligands is one of the main mechanisms used by immune cells to target stressed cells for cell death. NKG2D ligands are known markers of cellular stress and are often upregulated on tumor cells. Certain drugs can further increase NKG2D ligand levels, thereby making tumor cells more susceptible to immune cell detection and destruction. However, the effectiveness of this approach appears to be limited with drug treatment alone, possibly due to immune dysregulation in the setting of malignancies. We hypothesized that a more effective approach would be a combination of NKG2D ligand-inducing drugs, such as the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, and ex vivo-expanded peripheral blood {$\gamma\delta$} T cells (i.e., V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells). Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a high-risk hematologic malignancy, and treatment has shown limited benefit with the addition of bortezomib to standard chemotherapy regimens. Two AML cells lines, Nomo-1 and Kasumi-1, were treated with increasing concentrations of bortezomib, and changes in NKG2D ligand expression were measured. Bortezomib treatment significantly increased expression of the NKG2D ligand UL16 binding protein (ULBP) 2/5/6 in both cell lines. V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells were expanded and isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors to generate a final cellular product with a mean of 96\% CD3+/{$\gamma\delta$} T-cell receptor-positive cells. Combination treatment of the AML cell lines with {$\gamma\delta$} T cells and bortezomib resulted in significantly greater cytotoxicity than {$\gamma\delta$} T cells alone, even at lower effector-to-target ratios. Based on the positive results against AML and the generalizable mechanism of this combination approach, it was also tested against T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), another high-risk leukemia. Similarly, bortezomib increased ULBP 2/5/6 expression in T-ALL cell lines, Jurkat and MOLT-4 and improved the cytotoxicity of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells against each line. Collectively, these results show that bortezomib enhances {$\gamma\delta$} T-cell-mediated killing of both AML and T-ALL cells in part through increased NKG2D ligand-receptor interaction. Furthermore, proof-of-concept for the combination of ex vivo-expanded {$\gamma\delta$} T cells with stress ligand-inducing drugs as a therapeutic platform for high-risk leukemias is demonstrated.},

The vector copy number in TEG001 cells was on average a factor 0.72 (SD 0.11) below that of the producer cell clone. All nucleotide variants were transferred to TEG001 without having an effect on cellular proliferation during extensive in~vitro culture.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Engineering T cells with receptors to redirect the immune system against cancer has most recently been described as a scientific breakthrough. However, a main challenge remains the GMP-grade purification of immune cells selectively expressing the introduced receptor in order to reduce potential side effects due to poorly or nonengineered cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In order to test a novel purification strategy, we took advantage of a model {$\gamma\delta$}T cell receptor (TCR), naturally interfering with endogenous TCR expression and designed the optimal retroviral expression cassette to achieve maximal interference with endogenous TCR chains. Following retroviral transduction, nonengineered and poorly engineered immune cells characterized by a high endogenous {$\alpha\beta$}TCR expression were efficiently depleted with GMP-grade anti-{$\alpha\beta$}TCR beads. Next, the engineered immune cells were validated for TCR expression, function against a panel of tumor cell lines and primary tumors and potential allo-reactivity. Engineered immune cells were further validated in two humanized mouse tumor models. RESULTS: The untouched enrichment of engineered immune cells translated into highly purified receptor-engineered cells with strong antitumor reactivity both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, this approach eliminated residual allo-reactivity of engineered immune cells. Our data demonstrate that even with long-term suboptimal interference with endogenous TCR chains such as in resting cells, allo-reactivity remained absent and tumor control preserved. CONCLUSIONS: We present a novel enrichment method for the production of untouched engineered immune cells, ready to be translated into a GMP-grade method and potentially applicable to all receptor-modified cells even if interference with endogenous TCR chains is far from complete.},

  abstract = {Acquired immune evasion is one of the mechanisms that contributes to the dismal prognosis of cancer. Recently, we observed that different {$\gamma\delta$} T cell subsets as well as CD8+ {$\alpha\beta$} T cells infiltrate the pancreatic tissue. Interestingly, the abundance of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells was reported to have a positive prognostic impact on survival of cancer patients. Since {$\gamma\delta$} T cells utilize TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) for killing of tumor cells in addition to granzyme B and perforin, we investigated the role of the TRAIL-/TRAIL-R system in {$\gamma\delta$} T cell-cytotoxicity toward pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and other cancer cells. Coculture of the different cancer cells with {$\gamma\delta$} T cells resulted in a moderate lysis of tumor cells. The lysis of PDAC Colo357 cells was independent of TRAIL as it was not inhibited by the addition of neutralizing anti-TRAIL antibodies or TRAIL-R2-Fc fusion protein. In accordance, knockdown (KD) of death receptors TRAIL-R1 or TRAIL-R2 in Colo357 cells had no effect on {$\gamma\delta$} T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. However, KD of decoy receptor TRAIL-R4, which robustly enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis, interestingly, almost completely abolished the {$\gamma\delta$} T cell-mediated lysis of these tumor cells. This effect was associated with a reduced secretion of granzyme B by {$\gamma\delta$} T cells and enhanced PGE2 production as a result of increased expression level of synthetase cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 by TRAIL-R4-KD cells. In contrast, knockin of TRAIL-R4 decreased COX-2 expression. Importantly, reduced release of granzyme B by {$\gamma\delta$} T cells cocultured with TRAIL-R4-KD cells was partially reverted by bispecific antibody [HER2xCD3] and led in consequence to enhanced lysis of tumor cells. Likewise, inhibition of COX-1 and/or COX-2 partially enhanced {$\gamma\delta$} T cell-mediated lysis of TRAIL-R4-KD cells. The combination of bispecific antibody and COX-inhibitor completely restored the lysis of TRAIL-R4-KD cells by {$\gamma\delta$} T cells. In conclusion, we uncovered an unexpected novel role of TRAIL-R4 in tumor cells. In contrast to its known pro-tumoral, anti-apoptotic function, TRAIL-R4 augments the anti-tumoral cytotoxic activity of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells.},

  abstract = {Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs) typically arise in the central nervous system (CNS) of children under 3 years of age. Despite intensive multimodal therapy (surgery, chemotherapy and, if age permits, radiotherapy), median survival is 17 months1,2. We show that ATRTs robustly express B7-H3/CD276 that does not result from the inactivating mutations in SMARCB1 (refs. 3,4), which drive oncogenesis in ATRT, but requires residual SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) activity mediated by BRG1/SMARCA4. Consistent with the embryonic origin of ATRT5,6, B7-H3 is highly expressed on the prenatal, but not postnatal, brain. B7-H3.BB.z-chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells administered intracerebroventricularly or intratumorally mediate potent antitumor effects against cerebral ATRT xenografts in mice, with faster kinetics, greater potency and reduced systemic levels of inflammatory cytokines compared to CAR T cells administered intravenously. CAR T cells administered ICV also traffic from the CNS into the periphery; following clearance of ATRT xenografts, B7-H3.BB.z-CAR T cells administered intracerebroventricularly or intravenously mediate antigen-specific protection from tumor rechallenge, both in the brain and periphery. These results identify B7-H3 as a compelling therapeutic target for this largely incurable pediatric tumor and demonstrate important advantages of locoregional compared to systemic delivery of CAR T cells for the treatment of CNS malignancies.},

  abstract = {Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children, with an annual incidence of 10.5 per million children less than 15 years of age. NB accounts for 15\% of childhood cancer deaths. High risk (HR) patients carry a poor prognosis despite treatment with intensive chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiation, autologous bone marrow transplant, and treatment with cis-retinoic acid. New therapies are desperately needed for such patients. Recently, it has been demonstrated that HR NB patients benefit from anti-GD2 antibody therapy which directs the immune system against NB cells. To further explore means of harnessing the immune system to attack NB, the investigators are studying the combination of zoledronic acid (ZOL) and interleukin-2 (IL-2). ZOL has been demonstrated to have direct anti-neuroblastoma effects in laboratory studies. ZOL also augments the production of tumor killing white blood cells called gamma-delta T cells. When used in combination with IL-2, ZOL is capable of eliciting potent anti-cancer effects in patients, in part, via the expansion of gamma-delta T cells. In this present trial the investigators aim to study the tolerability of the combination of ZOL and IL-2 in pediatric NB patients. Patients will also be monitored radiologically for tumor response to therapy. Correlative biological studies will study the ability of this drug combination to elicit the production of NB killing gamma-delta T cells in children.},

  abstract = {The long-held view that gamma delta ({$\gamma\delta$}) T cells in mice and humans are fundamentally dissimilar, as are {$\gamma\delta$} cells in blood and peripheral tissues, has been challenged by emerging evidence of the cells' regulation by butyrophilin (BTN) and butyrophilin-like (BTNL) molecules. Thus, murine Btnl1 and the related gene, Skint1, mediate T cell receptor (TCR)-dependent selection of murine intraepithelial {$\gamma\delta$} T cell repertoires in gut and skin, respectively; BTNL3 and BTNL8 are TCR-dependent regulators of human gut {$\gamma\delta$} cells; and BTN3A1 is essential for TCR-dependent activation of human peripheral blood V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2+ T cells. However, some observations concerning BTN/Btnl molecules continue to question the extent of mechanistic conservation. In particular, murine and human gut {$\gamma\delta$} cell regulation depends on pairings of Btnl1 and Btnl6 and BTNL3 and BTNL8, respectively, whereas blood {$\gamma\delta$} cells are reported to be regulated by BTN3A1 independent of other BTNs. Addressing this paradox, we show that BTN3A2 regulates the subcellular localization of BTN3A1, including functionally important associations with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and is specifically required for optimal BTN3A1-mediated activation of V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2+ T cells. Evidence that BTNL3/BTNL8 and Btnl1/Btnl6 likewise associate with the ER reinforces the prospect of broadly conserved mechanisms underpinning the selection and activation of {$\gamma\delta$} cells in mice and humans, and in blood and extralymphoid sites.},

  abstract = {{$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2T cells play a major role in cancer immune surveillance, yet the clinical translation of their in vitro promise remains challenging. To address limitations of previous clinical attempts using expanded {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2T cells, we explored the clonal diversity of {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2T cell repertoires and characterized their target. We demonstrated that only a fraction of expanded {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2T cells was active against cancer cells and that activity of the parental clone, or functional avidity of selected {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2 T cell receptors ({$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2TCRs), was not associated with clonal frequency. Furthermore, we analyzed the target-receptor interface and provided a 2-receptor, 3-ligand model. We found that activation was initiated by binding of the {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2TCR to BTN2A1 through the regions between CDR2 and CDR3 of the TCR {$\gamma$} chain and modulated by the affinity of the CDR3 region of the TCR{$\delta$} chain, which was phosphoantigen independent (pAg independent) and did not depend on CD277. CD277 was secondary, serving as a mandatory coactivating ligand. We found that binding of CD277 to its putative ligand did not depend on the presence of {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2TCR, did depend on usage of the intracellular CD277, created pAg-dependent proximity to BTN2A1, enhanced cell-cell conjugate formation, and stabilized the immunological synapse (IS). This process critically depended on the affinity of the {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2TCR and required membrane flexibility of the {$\gamma$}9{$\delta$}2TCR and CD277, facilitating their polarization and high-density recruitment during IS formation.},

We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the safety of weekly intraperitoneal injections of in vitro expanded V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells together with zoledronate for the treatment of such malignant ascites. Patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with zoledronate (5 {$\mu$}mol/L) and interleukin-2 (1000 IU/mL). After 14 days culture, V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T-cells were harvested and administered intraperitoneally in four weekly infusions. The day before T-cell injection, patients received zoledronate (1 mg) to sensitize their tumor cells to V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T-cell recognition. Seven patients were enrolled in this study. The number of V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T-cells in each injection ranged from 0.6 to 69.8 \texttimes{} 10(8) (median 59.0 \texttimes{} 10(8)). There were no severe adverse events related to the therapy. Intraperitoneal injection of V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells allows them access to the tumor cells in the peritoneal cavity. The number of tumor cells in the ascites was significantly reduced even after the first round of therapy and remained substantially lower over the course of treatment. IFN-{$\gamma$} was detected in the ascites on treatment. Computed tomography revealed a significant reduction in volume of ascites in two of seven patients. Thus, injection of these antitumor V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T-cells can result in local control of malignant ascites in patients for whom no standard therapy apart from paracentesis is available. Adoptively transferred V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T-cells do indeed recognize tumor cells and exert antitumor effector activity in vivo, when they access to the tumor cells.},

In contrast, the clinical experience with CAR T~cell therapy for solid tumors and brain tumors has been less encouraging, with only a few patients achieving complete responses. Clinical and preclinical studies have identified multiple ``roadblocks,'' including (1) a limited array of targetable antigens and heterogeneous antigen expression, (2) limited T~cell fitness and survival before reaching tumor sites, (3) an inability of T~cells to efficiently traffic to tumor sites and penetrate physical barriers, and (4) an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, we review these challenges and discuss strategies that investigators have taken to improve the effector function of CAR T~cells for the adoptive immunotherapy of solid tumors.},

We described previously that synthetic aminobisphosphonates are potent {$\gamma\delta$} T cell stimulatory compounds that induce cytokine secretion (ie, interferon {$\gamma$} [IFN-{$\gamma$}]) and cell-mediated cytotoxicity against lymphoma and myeloma cell lines in vitro. To evaluate the antitumor activity of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells in vivo, we initiated a pilot study of low-dose interleukin 2 (IL-2) in combination with pamidronate in 19 patients with relapsed/refractory low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or multiple myeloma (MM). The objectives of this trial were to determine toxicity, the most effective dose for in vivo activation/proliferation of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells, and antilymphoma efficacy of the combination of pamidronate and IL-2. The first 10 patients (cohort A) who entered the study received 90 mg pamidronate intravenously on day 1 followed by increasing dose levels of continuous 24-hour intravenous (IV) infusions of IL-2 (0.25 to 3 \texttimes{} 106 IU/m2) from day 3 to day 8. Even at the highest IL-2 dose level in vivo, {$\gamma\delta$} T-cell activation/proliferation and response to treatment were disappointing with only 1 patient achieving stable disease. Therefore, the next 9 patients were selected by positive in vitro proliferation of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells in response to pamidronate/IL-2 and received a modified treatment schedule (6-hour bolus IV IL-2 infusions from day 1-6). In this patient group (cohort B), significant in vivo activation/proliferation of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells was observed in 5 patients (55\%), and objective responses (PR) were achieved in 3 patients (33\%). Only patients with significant in vivo proliferation of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells responded to treatment, indicating that {$\gamma\delta$} T cells might contribute to this antilymphoma effect. Overall, administration of pamidronate and low-dose IL-2 was well tolerated. In conclusion, this clinical trial demonstrates, for the first time, that {$\gamma\delta$} T-cell\textendash mediated immunotherapy is feasible and can induce objective tumor responses.

Mutations in germline-encoded V{$\gamma$}4 CDR2 and HV4 loops, but not in somatically recombined CDR3 loops, drastically diminished binding and T~cell responsiveness to BTNL3-BTNL8-expressing cells. Conversely, CDR3{$\gamma$} and CDR3{$\delta$} loops mediated LES TCR binding to endothelial protein C receptor, a clonally restricted autoantigen, with minimal CDR1, CDR2, or HV4 contributions. Thus, the {$\gamma\delta$} TCR can employ two discrete binding modalities: a non-clonotypic, superantigen-like interaction mediating subset-specific regulation by BTNL/BTN molecules and CDR3-dependent, antibody-like interactions mediating adaptive {$\gamma\delta$} T~cell biology.

Capable of broad polyclonal responses to pyrophosphate antigens (pAg), they are implicated in immunity to a diverse range of infections. Previously V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2+ development was thought to involve postnatal selection and amplification of public V{$\gamma$}9 clonotypes in response to microbial stimuli. However, recent data indicate the V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2+ T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, which is generated early in gestation, is dominated by public V{$\gamma$}9 clonotypes from birth. These chains bear highly distinct features compared to V{$\gamma$}9 chains from V{$\delta$}1+ T-cells, due either to temporal differences in recombination of each subset and/or potentially prenatal selection of pAg-reactive clonotypes. While these processes result in a semi-invariant repertoire featuring V{$\gamma$}9 sequences preconfigured for pAg recognition, alterations in TCR{$\delta$} repertoires between neonate and adult suggest either peripheral selection of clonotypes responsive to microbial antigens or altered postnatal thymic output of V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2+ T-cells. Interestingly, some individuals demonstrate private V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2+ expansions with distinct effector phenotypes, suggestive of selective expansion in response to microbial stimulation. The V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2+ T-cell subset, therefore, exhibits many features common to mouse {$\gamma\delta$} T-cell subsets, including early development, a semi-invariant TCR repertoire, and a reliance on butyrophilin-like molecules in antigen recognition. However, importantly V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2+ T-cells retain TCR sensitivity after acquiring an effector phenotype.

However, specific antigens recognized by {$\gamma\delta$}T cells are rarely identified, which has become the main restriction on such therapeutic application of {$\gamma\delta$}T cells. In this report, we identified a new peptide and protein antigen recognized by {$\gamma\delta$}T cells in HCC using our previous established strategy. First, we investigated the diversity of the {$\gamma$}9/{$\delta$}2 T-cell immunorepertoire by sequence analyses of the expressed complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) in HCC patients. Then, we constructed {$\gamma$}9/{$\delta$}2 T-cell receptor (TCR)-transfected cell lines expressing significant HCC CDR3 sequence and identified a series of peptides capable of binding to {$\gamma\delta$}T cells specifically. Next, we identified, further tested and verified the biological functions of these peptides and their matched protein by bioinformatics analysis. We identified that the new protein hepatocyte growth factor-like protein, also called as macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP), and peptide HP1, not only bound to HCC-predominant {$\gamma\delta$}TCR but also effectively activated {$\gamma\delta$}T cells isolated from HCC patients. Moreover, they could stimulate {$\gamma\delta$}T cells in peripheral blood from HCC patients to produce cytokines, which contributed to inhibiting HCC and played an important role in mediating cytotoxicity to HCC cell lines. In conclusion, we identified MSP and HP1, which showed potential as candidates for antigens recognized by {$\gamma\delta$}T cells in HCC.},

  abstract = {V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells are a minor subset of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood that has been extensively investigated for their tolerability, safety and anticancer efficacy. A hindrance to the broad application of these cells for adoptive cellular immunotherapy has been attaining clinically appropriate numbers of V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells. Furthermore, V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells exist at low frequencies among cancer patients. We, therefore, sought to conceive an economical method that allows for a quick and robust large-scale expansion of V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells. A two-step protocol was developed, in which peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors or cancer patients were activated with Zometa and interleukin (IL)-2, followed by co-culturing with gamma-irradiated, CD64-, CD86- and CD137L-expressing K562 artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) in the presence of the anti-CD3 antibody OKT3. We optimized the co-culture ratio of K562 aAPCs to immune cells, and migrated this method to a G-Rex cell growth platform to derive clinically relevant cell numbers in a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant manner. We further include a depletion step to selectively remove {$\alpha\beta$} T lymphocytes. The method exhibited high expansion folds and a specific enrichment of V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells. Expanded V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells displayed an effector memory phenotype with a concomitant down-regulated expression of inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors. Finally, we ascertained the cytotoxic activity of these expanded cells by using nonmodified and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engrafted V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells against a panel of solid tumor cells. Overall, we report an efficient approach to generate highly functional V{$\gamma$}9V{$\delta$}2 T cells in massive numbers suitable for clinical application in an allogeneic setting.},

  abstract = {{$\gamma\delta$} T cells have recently gained considerable attention as an attractive tool for cancer adoptive immunotherapy due to their potent anti-tumor activity and unique role in immunosurveillance. The remarkable success of engineered T cells for the treatment of hematological malignancies has revolutionized the field of adoptive cell immunotherapy. Accordingly, major efforts are underway to translate this exciting technology to the treatment of solid tumors and the development of allogeneic therapies. The unique features of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells, including their major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-independent anti-cancer activity, tissue tropism, and multivalent response against a broad spectrum of the tumors, render them ideal for designing universal 'third-party' cell products, with the potential to overcome the challenges of allogeneic cell therapy. In this review, we describe the crucial role of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells in anti-tumor immunosurveillance and we summarize the different approaches used for the ex vivo and in vivo expansion of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells suitable for the development of novel strategies for cancer therapy. We further discuss the different transduction strategies aiming at redirecting or improving the function of {$\gamma\delta$} T cells, as well as, the considerations for the clinical applications.},

  abstract = {Recently, B7-H3 was frequently reported to be overexpressed in various cancer types and has been suggested to be a promising target for cancer immunotherapy. In the present study, we analyzed the mRNA expression of B7-H3 in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and validated its expression across multiple cancer types. We then generated a novel B7-H3-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and tested its antitumor activity both in~vitro and in~vivo. The B7-H3 expression heterogeneity and variation were frequent. Moderate or even high expression levels of B7-H3 were also observed in some tumor-adjacent tissues, but the staining intensity was weaker than that in tumor tissues. B7-H3 expression was absent or very low in normal tissues and organs. Flow cytometry indicated that the mean expression level of B7-H3 in eight bone marrow specimens from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was 57.2\% (range 38.8\textendash 80.4). Furthermore, we showed that the B7-H3-targeted CAR-T cells exhibited significant antitumor activity against AML and melanoma in~vitro and in xenograft mouse models. In conclusion, although B7-H3 represents a promising pan-cancer target, and B7-H3-redirected CAR-T cells can effectively control tumor growth, the expression heterogeneity and variation have to be carefully considered in translating B7-H3-targeted CAR-T cell therapy into clinical practice., Zhang et~al. demonstrated that B7-H3 is highly expressed in multiple cancer types, and then they generated a B7-H3-targeted CAR and validated its antitumor effects both on hematologic and solid tumors. Their data also suggested that the expression heterogeneity and variation must be considered in translating B7-H3-targeted therapy into clinical practice.},

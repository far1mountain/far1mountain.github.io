  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Gamma delta T ({$\gamma\delta$}T) lymphocytes are primed for rapid function, including cytotoxicity toward cancer cells, and are a component of the immediate stress response. Following activation, they can function as professional antigen-presenting cells. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) work by focusing T cell function on defined cell surface tumor antigens and provide essential costimulation for robust activation. Given the natural tropism of {$\gamma\delta$}T cells for the tumor microenvironment, we hypothesized that their transduction with CARs might enhance cytotoxicity while retaining their ability to migrate to tumor and act as antigen-presenting cells to prolong the intratumoral immune response. Using a GD2-targeting CAR as a model system, we showed that {$\gamma\delta$}T cells of both V{$\delta$}1 and V{$\delta$}2 subsets could be expanded and transduced to sufficient numbers for clinical studies. The CAR added to the cells' innate cytotoxicity by enhancing GD2-specific killing of GD2-expressing cancer cell lines. Migration toward tumor cells \emph{in vitro} was not impaired by the presence of the CAR. Expanded CAR-transduced V{$\delta$}2 cells retained the ability to take up tumor antigens and cross presented the processed peptide to responder alpha beta T ({$\alpha\beta$}T) lymphocytes. {$\gamma\delta$} CAR-T cell products show promise for evaluation in clinical studies of solid tumors.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Human adenovirus infection is life threatening after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Immunotherapy with donor-derived adenovirus-specific T cells is promising; however, 20\% of all donors lack adenovirus-specific T cells. To overcome this, we transfected {$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} T cells with mRNA encoding a T-cell receptor (TCR) specific for the HLA-A*0101-restricted peptide LTDLGQNLLY from the adenovirus hexon protein. Furthermore, since allo-reactive endogenous TCR of donor T lymphocytes would induce graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in a mismatched patient, we transferred the TCR into {$\gamma$}/{$\delta$} T cells, which are not allo-reactive. TCR-transfected {$\gamma$}/{$\delta$} T cells secreted low quantities of cytokines after antigen-specific stimulation, which were increased dramatically after co-transfection of CD8{$\alpha$}-encoding mRNA. In direct comparison with TCR-transfected {$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} T cells, TCR-CD8{$\alpha$}-co-transfected {$\gamma$}/{$\delta$} T cells produced more tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and lysed peptide-loaded target cells as efficiently. Most importantly, TCR-transfected {$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} T cells and TCR-CD8{$\alpha$}-co-transfected {$\gamma$}/{$\delta$} T cells efficiently lysed adenovirus-infected target cells. We show here, for the first time, that not only {$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} T cells but also {$\gamma$}/{$\delta$} T cells can be equipped with an adenovirus specificity by TCR-RNA electroporation. Thus, our strategy offers a new means for the immunotherapy of adenovirus infection after allogeneic HSCT.},

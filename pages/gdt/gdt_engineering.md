## TCR-T

### 1. αβTCR转染到γδT细胞中。

### 2. γδTCR转染到αβT细胞中。

### 3. iNKT TCR转染到γδT细胞中。

### 4. 特定肿瘤识别TCR转染到γδT细胞。

## CAR-T

### 第一代CAR-T

First generation CARs are composed of an extracellular binding domain, a hinge region, a transmembrane domain, and one or more intracellular signaling domains.

GD2 CAR

### 第二代CAR-T

Second generation CARs add a co‐stimulatory domain, like CD28 or 4‐1BB. The involvement of these intracellular signaling domains improve T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, resistance to apoptosis, and in vivo persistence


### 第三代CAR-T

Third generation CARs combine multiple co-stimulatory domains, such as CD28-41BB or CD28-OX40, to augment T cell activity. Preclinical data show the third-generation CARs exhibit improved effector functions and better in vivo persistence as compared to second‐generation CARs

### 第四代CAR-T

Fourth generation CARs (also known as TRUCKs or armored CARs) further add factors that enhance T cell expansion, persistence, and anti‐tumoral activity. This can include cytokines, such is IL-2, IL-5, IL-12 and co‐stimulatory ligands.

### SUPER CAR

Multiple mechanisms can be deployed to finely regulate the activity of SUPRA CAR, which limits overactivation. In contrast to the traditional CAR design, SUPRA CAR allows targeting of multiple antigens without further genetic modification of a person's immune cells
